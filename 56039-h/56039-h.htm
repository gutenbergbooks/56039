<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'><em>Much of the material included in this volume
was collected several years ago while the
author was a graduate student at the University
of Pennsylvania. The researches then commenced
probably first suggested to him the lack in our
political literature of an ample and interesting account
of the return of the States. Students, librarians, and
even professors of history knew no adequate treatise on
the era of reconstruction, and their testimony was confirmed
by the authority of Mr. Bryce, who happily
describes the succession of events in those crowded times
as forming one of the most intricate chapters of American
history. No apology is offered, therefore, for
considering in this essay so important and so long-neglected
a theme as the rise of the political revolution that
occurred before reunion was finally accomplished.</em></p>

<p class='c000'><em>On the general subject several excellent monographs
have recently appeared; these, however, are nearly all
employed in discussing the second stage in the process
of restoration, and, except incidentally, anticipate
scarcely anything of value in the present work, which,
so far at least as concerns any logical exposition, conducts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>the reader over untraveled ground. As the
introduction indicates with sufficient accuracy both the
scope and method of this study, nothing is required here
beyond a concise statement of the author’s obligations.</em></p>

<p class='c000'><em>Like many other students of American institutions,
the writer cheerfully acknowledges his indebtedness to
the works of Brownson, Hurd and Jameson, and, by
transferring some of their opinions to his book, has
shown a practical appreciation of their researches. In
addition to these obligations, in which the author is not

  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>So closely blended with the essential principles of our
federal system of government were the causes of
the Civil War that a clear understanding of its results
appears to require some account of the origin, the
independence and the permanent union of these States.
Upon the eventful years between the Treaty of Paris and
the Declaration of Independence, crowded as they are with
work of note, one could linger with pleasure; this epoch,
however, has already engaged the pens of so many writers,
eminent as well as obscure, that a re-study of the blunders
of England’s ministers and the revolt of her distant colonies
might justly be regarded as a piece of presumption.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor does it seem necessary to recite the familiar achievements
of the succeeding period; for, perhaps, the portion
of American history most attractive to the general reader
is included between the 4th of July, 1776, and the 4th of
March, 1789. To these years belong the most conspicuous
services of that giant race of leaders whose swords relieved
a gallant people from oppression and whose wisdom
established a form of government not, indeed, in universal
harmony with popular prejudice, but admirably designed
for the popular welfare.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was at the outset of what may properly be styled
the national era that there appeared the remarkable group
of statesmen who guided the infant Republic on its dim
and perilous way. On their broad experience gleamed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>a vision of the future touching all their work with elements
of immortality. By them was skillfully established a system
of revenue and of finance adequate to all the exigencies of
the time, and a foreign policy inaugurated which for generations
together preserved unbroken harmony with the
world outside. They doubled by wise and peaceful acquisition
the area of that Union whose independence had been
wrested from George the Third, and with no less wisdom
prescribed the procedure and defined the jurisdiction of
Federal courts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The forty years following March 4, 1789, form an
epoch with characteristics of its own. This was the period
of Virginian ascendency, the Adamses alone breaking the
line of illustrious Presidents furnished by the Old Dominion.
Introduced by an experiment in government which
aroused the slumbering energies of the nation, its conclusion
was marked by the disappearance from political life
of the splendid ideals and rich traditions of the Fathers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The election of General Jackson coincides with the beginning
of a new phase in American political and industrial
development. It was not that the fame of a splendid
military record had raised its possessor to an office for
which long experience in governmental affairs had hitherto
been thought indispensable, or that the selection of Presidents
had passed from an intellectual few to the control of
a much more numerous class who were willing to bestow
on politics the attention and energy requisite for success in
trade; but it was about this time that the imperious power of
slavery entered upon its career of aggression. Philosophic
statesmen of a previous epoch had ardently hoped that the
institution would be permitted quietly to disappear; indeed,
the greatest among them, though divided upon a multitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>of political and economic questions, agreed in encouraging
every movement designed for its extinction. These humane
efforts, however, were not destined to win immediate
success, and even with the coöperation of the General
Government served only to demonstrate the difficulty of
such an undertaking.</p>

<p class='c000'>After 1820 all the dangers which menaced the integrity
of the Union were, with one notable exception, traceable
to this cause. When Mr. Lincoln in his discussions with
Senator Douglas declared that it was the sole cause of all
the troubles which had disturbed the nation, he meant,
probably, to assert no more than that in his own time it had
been the most conspicuous one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Long before slavery became a subject of embittered controversy
the doctrine of State Rights had agitated the
country. As early as the summer of 1793 it had found in
Justice Iredell an able advocate on the bench of the United
States Supreme Court. For party purposes it was adopted
five years later by Madison and Jefferson in the celebrated
Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions, and during the second
war with Great Britain these statesmen were startled to
find New England Federalism vindicating its unpatriotic,
if not treacherous, conduct in the exact language which
they had invented to embarrass a former administration.
With this instrument, too, Calhoun in 1832 shook the
foundations of the Union. Both Northern and Southern
statesmen of that generation, however, pushed the principle
of State sovereignty as far only as their immediate object
seemed to require.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a popular mistake to suppose that beyond the
limits of the South this erroneous doctrine found little
favor in the minds of men; for on the eve of the War of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>1812 a Governor of conservative Pennsylvania had armed
her citizen-soldiers against Federal power.</p>

<p class='c000'>The illustrious Marshall could relate how, before the
highest tribunal in the land, its champions with unwearied
zeal renewed the battle for a hopeless cause. The eloquent
voice of Webster hushed for a time the fretful agitation of
South Carolina statesmen, and his genius fixed in imperishable
literary form that interpretation of the Constitution
which called forth the abundant resources of both the
Nation and the States. In his conquering words lived
those elevated thoughts that in future years sustained the
defenders of the Republic.</p>

<p class='c000'>President Jackson, for the energy and promptness by
which he defeated the projects of the Nullifiers, has been
justly eulogized; but, when the excitement of the hour
had passed away, the calmer judgment of even his admirers
perceived that victory inclined rather to the side of
Calhoun.</p>

<p class='c000'>Discussion of the abstract question of State sovereignty
might, probably, have long continued without endangering
the Union had the principle not been invoked to defend
the institution of human servitude; yoked to that
powerful interest it was inevitable that both should go
down together in undistinguishable ruin.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the Protean fount of slavery flowed an hundred
various streams coloring almost every important question
in the tide of events. In the generation between the
election of General Jackson and the inauguration of Mr.
Lincoln its defeats were few, its triumphs numerous and
important. Prosperity revealed its weaknesses and encouraged
its experiments. The fruits of its greatest victory,
the dismemberment of Mexico, revived those stormy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>scenes which thirty years before had for the first time been
witnessed in an American legislative hall. Dissolution of
the Union was once more threatened, and again averted
by the genius and patriotism of the venerable triumvirate,
who scarce outlived their noble work; but the compromise
from which Clay, Calhoun and Webster expected a restoration
of former tranquillity contained within itself the very
seed-plot of even graver troubles.</p>

<p class='c000'>After 1850 the attachment of Southern men to their industrial
system was played upon by ambitious politicians
more and more, until the final overthrow of themselves
and the government which they sought to establish for its
preservation. It could be shown how before that time
one war was prolonged for the protection, and another
undertaken chiefly for the extension, of that aggressive
institution; how its existence was supposed to require
Federal interference with the mails and an abridgment of
even the ancient right of petition. Every power of the
national Government and all the resources of the cotton
States had been employed for its advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The United States Supreme Court was the last agent
within the Union by which its advocates sought to dignify
and perpetuate human servitude, and so successful were
their efforts that an enlightened and humane Chief Justice
was but little misrepresented in language or in sentiment
when political opponents ascribed to him the doctrine
that “the negro has no rights which the white man is
bound to respect.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The moral progress of the United States during the
last forty years finds, probably, in no single event a better
illustration than the change in public opinion upon the
interesting question of human rights. When the majority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>opinion was delivered in the Dred Scott case it excited
among members of the dominant political party but little
surprise. The shock which a judicial utterance of such
sentiments would give in our time to the ethical notions
of the American people affords at once both a measure of
the advance that has been made in the interval and an
undoubted proof that progress has not been, as is commonly
supposed, exclusively or even mainly along material
lines. It is singular, too, that the first serious attempt of
the Federal Supreme Court to set at rest a dangerous
political question should have been followed by effects of
so alarming a tendency.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not intended to relate in these pages the origin or
the fate of those compromises designed to avoid the inevitable
conflict already in the closing months of President
Buchanan’s administration casting ominous shadows in the
pathway of the nation, nor to describe the uncertain policy
of the General Government or attempt to determine the
measure of its responsibility for the fearful rebellion which
that hesitation encouraged.</p>

<p class='c000'>The skill and industry of a multitude of laborers have
gathered from the field of conflict a harvest as bountiful as
the result was satisfactory. We have general histories
and bird’s-eye views, military accounts and naval accounts
of the Civil War; memoirs and diaries, by actors more or
less prominent in the events which they describe, and narratives
of battles and of sieges. In this varied and ample
field even a belated worker might hope to glean something
of value; but this study, whatever it may discuss
incidentally, will be chiefly concerned with the subject of
Reconstruction, a phase of our political and constitutional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>development which, though beginning during the progress,
lies mainly beyond the close of the Rebellion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The organization into a separate government of the late
Confederate States, with their resolute struggle for independence,
is the chief event in the extraordinary career
of this favored nation. The story of their submission to
Federal power and the return to their former places in the
Union is not inferior either in interest or instruction to
any political event recorded in history. This return is
what is commonly known as Reconstruction. Though
the term on its introduction into political discussion was
frequently objected to as inaccurate, it has been generally
adopted in the writings of publicists as well as in popular
speech. The word “restoration,” which was at first preferred,
was soon found to be inexact; for while former relations
were resumed by the erring States, they came back,
one with diminished territorial extent and all with domestic
rights greatly abridged. They had, in fact, been <em>reconstructed</em>.
It is true that even the loyal States did not
emerge unscathed from this political revolution. In the
South, however, the established industrial system had been
swept completely away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The theme falls naturally under two heads, Presidential
Reconstruction and Congressional Reconstruction. An
account of the former, which extended from the summer
of 1861 to the autumn of 1865, occupies the whole of this
volume. Any adequate treatment of the latter, including
as it does the eventful period from the meeting of Congress
in December, 1865, to the withdrawal of Federal
forces from the South in 1877, will require a narrative
somewhat more ample.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conspicuous landmarks of Reconstruction require
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>no extraordinary talent to recognize and locate. It is the
unfamiliar region between that is difficult accurately to
map out. The failure hitherto to present in a single view
the striking features of these neglected parts is chiefly
responsible for the fact that Reconstruction remains one
of the most obscure parts of our history. A candid and
comprehensive account of the political events of the time
appears to divest the subject of much of the difficulty
commonly supposed to attend its investigation. From a
sufficient body of essential facts the step to an understanding
and exposition of every principle of moment is
comparatively easy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the general design of this volume will be suggested
to the student of American history by an inspection
of its principal subdivisions, it may not be unnecessary for
the benefit of the general reader to add a brief outline of
the plan that has been adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chapter I. relates the most important political events
in the history of Tennessee from its attempted secession
to the restoration, in March, 1865, of a civil government
loyal to the United States. Military movements in that
Commonwealth have been noticed only so far as to render
intelligible the successive steps by which that reorganization
was accomplished.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chapters II. and III. bring the affairs of Louisiana
and Arkansas, respectively, down to about the same time.
Events in those States have been treated, so far as conditions
permitted, in the same manner as in the case of
Tennessee.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chapter IV. is concerned with the secession, restoration
and dismemberment of Virginia. The formation out of a
portion of that Commonwealth of the new State of West
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>Virginia, both because of the grave constitutional question
which arose on a division of the parent State and the
intrinsic interest of the subject, has been considered with
some degree of minuteness.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Chapter V., which discusses anti-slavery legislation,
it will appear how Mr. Lincoln, though never an Abolitionist
or even a radical Republican, became by pressure
of military necessity an instrument in the hands of God
to destroy an institution opposed by a long line of
American statesmen and condemned by the light of the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c000'>The succeeding chapter considers the various theories
and plans of restoration presented during the progress of
the war. The rise of the Congressional plan, which
ultimately prevailed, is treated separately in Chapter VII.
Only the first stage of its development, however, falls
within the limits of this inquiry, which ends with the
meeting of the Thirty-ninth Congress in December,
1865.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chapters VIII., IX. and X. trace the progress of the
controversy between the Legislative and the Executive
branches of Government. The culmination of this difference,
however, in the impeachment and trial of President
Johnson is a phase of Congressional Reconstruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The topics treated in the eleventh chapter, having frequently
employed the pens of able and popular writers on
the Rebellion, are considered in this study merely for the
purpose of making it complete in itself; hence that section
is little more than an epitome of what has already been
said on those subjects.</p>

<p class='c000'>The twelfth and last chapter brings every part of the
narrative up to December 4, 1865. To clearly comprehend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>the arduous task that confronted President Johnson
this section includes a rapid survey of the wreck of the
Confederate States. The principal part, however, is reserved
for an account of the conventions assembled under
his authority, the method of instituting loyal governments
and the spirit and tendency of Southern legislation relative
to freedmen. An examination of the Presidential
plan of Reconstruction completes the volume.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>While the celebrated joint debates with Senator
Douglas in 1858, the Cooper Union and other
addresses, marked Mr. Lincoln, in the new political
party just rising to power, as the intellectual peer of able
and trusted leaders like Sumner, Chase and Seward, his conservative
opinions on the subject of slavery made his nomination
by the Chicago Convention more acceptable to delegates
from the border States. Though his competitors received, in
the memorable contest which followed, almost a million votes
in excess of the number cast for Mr. Lincoln and his associate,
the fierce conflict among fragments of the Democratic party
resulted, as is well known, in the choice of a decided majority
of Republican electors.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> This rather unexpected defeat of a
political organization that had lost but two Presidential contests
since its first success under Jefferson afforded Southern
leaders a pretext for urging a dismemberment of the Union.
Indeed, there is evidence that the more impetuous among them
had, four years earlier, seriously determined, in case of Fremont’s
election, upon a similar course.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Thus the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>event, so far from being an universal disappointment to members
of the defeated party, had been ardently hoped for by
many.</p>

<p class='c000'>The choice of a minority party, and not at first possessing
the entire confidence of even that minority, Mr. Lincoln, unable
to divine the future, was compelled in dealing with the
insurrection to proceed with the utmost caution. Washington
himself, in organizing the Federal Government, had a
task of less magnitude, and the renown of his military achievements
silenced for a time even the boldest in opposition.
President Lincoln’s victories, gained on a different field, gave
no such unquestioned authority to his name. This peculiar
situation forced him to adopt for the guidance of his administration
a policy not altogether free from embarrassment to
both himself and his successor. His purpose at that time
appears to have been to meet the demands of the moment by
the contrivances of the moment. Whether a different course
would have been rewarded by earlier or by more complete
success is a hazardous subject for speculation. If his theory
of our national existence be liable to the multitude of objections
which have grown up in these fruitful times of peace, no
other has been suggested that is free from criticism. His
political doctrine, too, had the advantage of always recommending
measures scarcely less distinguished for enlarged
views than those enlightened convictions which characterize
his first inaugural address. Whatever may be concluded of
its merits, the theory embraced at the outset exerted on many
administrative acts of President Lincoln an influence that
continued to be felt during his entire executive career; and
without remembering this fact we shall not easily comprehend
either the extent of his “Border Policy,” as the plan of
compensated emancipation is often called, or his undoubted
concern for persecuted Union men in the seceded States.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sufferings of loyal citizens in East Tennessee had early
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>enlisted the President’s sympathies, and almost from the commencement
of hostilities measures for their relief formed in
his mind part of the plan of operations by the army under
General Buell. Writing, January 6, 1862, to that commander
he gives reasons for suggesting the occupation of some point
there rather than Nashville, and adds: “But my distress is
that our friends in East Tennessee are being hanged and
driven to despair, and even now, I fear, are thinking of taking
rebel arms for the sake of personal protection. In this we
lose the most valuable stake we have in the South.”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a> The
cause of these outrages may be briefly explained in a digression.</p>

<p class='c000'>In no part of the late Confederate States was the slave
interest more feeble than in the thirty counties comprising
East Tennessee.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a> That portion of the State contained in 1860
slightly over 300,000 inhabitants,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> of whom only about one
tenth were slaves, while in many counties they formed no
more than one in seventeen of the population. Here and
there, indeed, were persons of wealth some of whom owned
a few negroes. But though a majority of the people looked
upon domestic slavery as something foreign to their social
life, they had no strong philanthropic impulse to oppose it.
While quite willing to allow their countrymen elsewhere to
keep bondmen at pleasure, they did not regard it any concern
of theirs to assist either in extending or perpetuating human
servitude. If the existence of the Union or of slavery was
the issue, they would have hesitated little in deciding which
should perish. Though, as we shall presently see, they were
as intolerant of the Republican party as any community in
the South, they were devotedly attached to the Union. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>fact is partly explained by the industrial basis of society in
this favored region.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cut off from Middle Tennessee by lofty ranges of the
Cumberland, and from North Carolina by the Great Smoky,
the Black and the Stone mountains, this extensive district is
traversed in its entire length by the Tennessee and its chief
tributaries, the Clinch and the Holston; as the great river
flows down to Alabama it receives, before turning west and
north to join the Ohio, the waters of many important and
beautiful streams, some of which, as the French Broad and
Nolachucky, are associated with deeds of note in the War
for Independence; indeed, one of its crowning victories was
chiefly won by settlers from the banks of the Watauga.
Other names, like Hiwassee, are familiar to readers of later
events in Tennessee history, and Chickamauga Creek was
destined shortly to become more famous than any.</p>

<p class='c000'>Knoxville, in early times a capital of the State, was, in
1860, the metropolis of East Tennessee; Chattanooga, at the
southern extremity of the valley, is separated from Bristol, on
the Virginia line, by a distance of more than two hundred and
forty miles; Cleveland and Greenville were towns of less
importance. The absence of large cities makes it evident that
manufacturing had not yet begun to attract serious attention.
Like early settlers everywhere in America, the pioneers of
Tennessee sought the most immediate returns from the products
of the forests and fields around them. The rich mineral
deposits, then either unknown or almost untouched, had not
given rise to those great extractive operations which in our
time have so stimulated the commercial life of East Tennessee.
Vast cotton plantations, worked by multitudes of
slaves, like those in the western portion of the State, had no
existence in these mountain valleys, though occasionally small
“patches” were cultivated for domestic use.</p>

<p class='c000'>Citizens of West Tennessee would naturally place upon the
Federal Constitution an interested construction; their industries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>they believed, required such an interpretation of that
instrument as would place the institution of slavery beyond
the reach of Congressional interference. While the people
of East Tennessee, too, believed in the several sovereignty of
the States, the question of slavery did not touch them so
nearly. Indifferent to the subject themselves, they had little
sympathy with those who had determined to break up the
Union from a mere suspicion that their interests were menaced
by the success of a new political party. But to ascribe
to the want of interested motives their indifference to the
great disturbing question of the time would be to assign
but one and that, perhaps, not the chief cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>Except on its northern and southern boundaries this delightful
region is practically isolated from several adjacent
States as well as from the remainder of Tennessee. It was in
this by-place of nature and amidst such a population that <cite>The
Manumission Intelligencer</cite>, a weekly newspaper, made its
appearance in 1819.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a> It was followed the next year by <cite>The
Emancipator</cite> of Elijah Embree, a Pennsylvania Quaker; this
in turn was soon succeeded by a more celebrated publication,
<cite>The Genius of Universal Emancipation</cite>, conducted by Benjamin
Lundy. While these publications served to perpetuate
and to extend, they did not create the sentiment of which they
became exponents, for, several years before their appearance,
an anti-slavery society flourished in Jefferson County. Its
existence is noticed as early as 1814.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> This anti-slavery feeling
was part of the philosophic movement encouraged by
nearly all Southern as well as Northern statesmen before
the inauguration of General Jackson. A new industrial era,
beginning about that time, put an end to the abolition societies
in the South; and though Lundy’s paper was discontinued
in Tennessee after 1824, events of frequent occurrence sustained
the anti-slavery sentiments of the people.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>The Tennessee valley was a natural thoroughfare from Virginia
to the south-west, and when slaves were purchased on
the Potomac they were chained together, to prevent escape,
and in that condition driven to the homes of their new
masters.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a> The plaintive songs of captives as they were
marched in lines along the valley highways often caused the
free mountaineer to pause in his labors and reflect on what
was passing before his eyes. He “saw slavery in its bitterness
and without disguise.” The remembrance of such
spectacles was apt to strengthen in him anti-slavery feelings
that had come down from Revolutionary times. But whether
Southern leaders ascribed the sentiment to an inherited tendency
or regarded it as a consequence of this odious phase of
the domestic slave-trade, they did not think it beneath the
dignity of attention; for it was, doubtless, to create a sympathy
for their institution that a “Southern Commercial
Convention” was held at Knoxville in 1857. It was too late,
however, to root out the convictions of two generations; the
counsels of the wise were soon to be confounded and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>fretful agitation of leaders soon to be hushed in the tempest
of war.</p>

<p class='c000'>No Republican electoral ticket was presented in the great
political battle of 1860 for the suffrage of Tennessee voters,
and had any citizen openly advocated the election of Mr.
Lincoln he would have had to endure insult or injury, or to
abandon his home. This explains why the successful candidates
received no vote in all the State. As “Parson”
Brownlow, selecting extreme abolition and secession types,
characteristically expressed it, his people were equally
opposed to the William L. Garrisons and the William L. Yanceys
of politics.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a> In this situation the supporters of Bell,
Breckenridge and Douglas were left to contend for victory
among themselves. Addresses of the time reveal not only
the emotions of individual speakers, but the excited state
of public opinion. The attitude of Constitutional Union
men was vigorously stated in a debate at Knoxville by Nathaniel
G. Taylor, an elector on the Bell and Everett ticket.
“The people of East Tennessee,” said the orator, “are determined
to maintain the Union by force of arms against
any movement from the South throughout their region of
country to assail the government at Washington with violence,
and that the secessionists of the cotton States in attempting
to carry out their nefarious design to destroy the
Republic would have to march over his dead body and the
dead bodies of thousands of East Tennessee mountaineers
slain in battle.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When Yancey came up from Alabama to “precipitate” this
section into rebellion the intrepid Brownlow made a similar
reply.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> The energy or the elegance of such utterances may
be questioned, but the deeds of loyal Tennesseeans during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>eventful years to follow are evidence alike of the sincerity of
the speakers and their insight into the temper of the times.</p>

<p class='c000'>Except Tennessee, all the States that attempted secession
did so by means of revolutionary bodies styled conventions;
this description of them is justified both by the general powers
of administration and government which they assumed and
by the fact that the legislatures in convoking them transcended
their authority, the members of every State legislature
being “bound by oath or affirmation to support” the
Federal Constitution, which forms a part of the fundamental
law of each commonwealth. Though the Legislature of
Tennessee, following the example of law-making bodies in
other disloyal States, passed a “Convention Bill,” it was
promptly defeated by a majority of 13,204 in a total vote of
more than 120,000. Notwithstanding the constitutional prohibition
that “no State shall enter into any treaty, alliance,
or confederation,”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> the Legislature on May 1 authorized
Governor Harris to appoint commissioners to form a military
league with the Confederate States. Six days later the relations
entered into by these agents were ratified in a secret
session, the State government thereby turning over temporarily
to the President of the Confederacy its entire military
force. These matters disposed of, the plans of disunionists
were completed by the passage on the same day of a declaration
of independence and an ordinance dissolving all Federal
relations between Tennessee and the United States. Though
this measure was to be voted upon a month later, the Legislature,
as if anticipating the result, adopted and ratified the
Confederate constitution. What was so ardently desired by
secessionists was finally accomplished, and on June 24 the
Governor declared his State out of the Union, the vote being
104,019 for, and 47,238 against, separation.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a> The Tennessee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Legislature did not assume the functions of a secession
convention till after the commencement of hostilities; but
from that date the forms of law ceased to be seriously regarded.
While the disunion party scored a present triumph,
loyalist leaders like Horace Maynard, Thomas A. R. Nelson
and Andrew Johnson, at the imminent risk of injury or even
of death, were speaking and working actively against the
spirit of secession. The strong Union feeling thus excited resulted
ultimately in local insurrections and in the meeting,
June 17, of a convention at Greeneville in which a remonstrance
was adopted and a committee appointed to petition the
Legislature for the separation of East Tennessee and such
counties of Middle Tennessee as were willing to coöperate in
the formation of a new commonwealth. But the presence
there during the following years of veteran Confederate
armies prevented Union men from organizing a separate government,
and saved the State from the fate of Virginia.
All who were known to have had a connection, or who were
suspected of sympathy, with this movement were especially
obnoxious to the secession party, and at the hands of soldiers
were subjected to many indignities. In various ways the
feeling of opposition to the Confederacy was intensified, and
it was not long before measures of retaliation were considered.
Union people were quick to perceive the advantage which the
South derived from the use of railways within the State, and,
in expectation of assistance from Federal forces in Kentucky,
five railroad bridges were burned. East Tennesseeans, however,
were destined to be sorely disappointed in the matter of
aid from the Union army; and, without effective organization
or arms, were easily captured or dispersed. Of the former,
many were sent as prisoners of war to Alabama, hundreds
were crowded into loathsome jails in the State and others
hanged, with circumstances of deliberate cruelty, near the
scenes of their alleged crimes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>These were among the outrages to which Mr. Lincoln
referred in his letter to the Federal commander. By Horace
Maynard a Representative, and Andrew Johnson a Senator,
in Congress the President was kept very accurately informed
of events in the State and often importuned to relieve their
constituents. This he constantly endeavored to do, but his
intentions were effectually defeated by the inactivity of General
Buell, who cherished other plans for destroying his
antagonist. More than two years were to elapse, from the
time President Lincoln urged his policy, before Tennesseeans
received any aid from Federal armies; long before that time
they had been ruthlessly punished for their patriotism, and
then their oppressors were chastised by the hand of an abler
warrior than General Buell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within a month from the date of President Lincoln’s letter
of January 6 General Grant had possession of Fort Henry and,
ten days later, February 16, received the surrender of Fort
Donelson. Nashville, becoming unsafe, was evacuated on
February 23, 1862; the State appeared for the first time to
be slipping from the grasp of the Confederacy, and a question,
hitherto more or less academic, presented itself for practical
settlement. In the territory from which hostile armies were
reluctantly retiring there would be involved a great derangement
in the administration of local civil law from the necessary
displacement there of all officials heretofore acting in
obedience to the Confederate States.</p>

<p class='c000'>By other Union victories in the Spring of 1862 the same
situation confronted the Federal Government in Arkansas,
in North Carolina and in Louisiana. Indeed, this identical
question arose as early as 1861 in Virginia and Missouri,
but in the former the rebel government was abrogated by a
delegate convention that restored a loyal government from
which in due time sprang the separate State of West Virginia.
In Missouri a lawfully chosen convention appointed a provisional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>government in sympathy with the Union. This subject,
however, will be more conveniently discussed elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>When General Johnston received tidings of the disaster
at Donelson he retired with his army to Murfreesboro, leaving
Nashville, which he was unable to protect, a scene of
panic and dismay, first advising Governor Harris to secure
the public archives and convoke the Legislature elsewhere. It
was in these circumstances that President Lincoln, on the
same day, February 23, nominated, and the Senate, March 5,
1862, confirmed, Andrew Johnson as military governor of
Tennessee with the rank of brigadier-general. As the commission
antedates the action of the Senate by two days the
President, no doubt, consulted the leaders of that body relative
to the contemplated nomination, and received assurance
of its favorable consideration.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing in any way connected with the appointment of
Senator Johnson, who was destined to act so conspicuous a
part in the important and difficult work of reconstruction, can
fail to be of interest, and any account of the execution of his
office would be incomplete without some observations on the
nature of his commission of which the following is a copy:</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>War Department</span>, <em>March 3, 1862</em>.</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>To the</em> <span class='sc'>Hon. Andrew Johnson</span>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>: You are hereby appointed military governor of the State of Tennessee,
with authority to exercise and perform, within the limits of that
State, all and singular the powers, duties, and functions pertaining to
the office of military governor, including the power to establish all necessary
offices, tribunals, etc.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Edwin M. Stanton</span>,</div>
      <div class='line in4'><em>Secretary of War</em>.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Quoting the essential part of this document a recent coöperative
work has this comment: “The office [that of military
governor] was new to the laws and history of the State
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>and country. Its powers and duties were limited only by the
will of one man, the occupant.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a> From the commission itself
we derive our prime conception of both the nature of the
office and the functions which it comprehended. The authority
of the incumbent extended to the exercise, within the
limits of Tennessee, of all “the powers, duties, and functions
pertaining to the office of military governor.” Nothing in
this language implies that the office was of recent creation.
Nor is its nature to be discovered by a perusal of the supplemental
authority contained in the President’s letter of September
19, 1863, to Governor Johnson, for the official conduct
of the latter on his arrival in Nashville can not be seriously
thought to have been influenced by instructions received
nineteen months later. It is perfectly true, as Mr. Ira
P. Jones, author of the chapter on Reconstruction in Tennessee,
asserts, that the office of military governor had never
been exercised within that State; but it is not a fact that it
was new to the laws and history of the “country,” if by this
indefinite expression he means the United States. During
the war with Mexico the American people had been made
familiar with military commissions and with military governors.
Secretary Marcy prepared, June 3, 1846, for General
Stephen W. Kearny the following instructions: “Should
you conquer and take possession of New Mexico and Upper
California, or considerable places in either, you will establish
temporary civil governments therein.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a> To this direction
general rules of conduct were added, and the letter authorized
the assurance that “It is the wish and design of the United
States to provide for them [the people of New Mexico] a
free government with the least possible delay, similar to that
which exists in our Territories.” By virtue of this authority
General Kearny appointed Charles Bent governor of New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Mexico. Mr. Polk in his Message of July 6, 1848, to Congress
maintained that with the termination of war his power
to establish temporary civil governments over New Mexico
and California had ceased; the legality of their previous existence
he justified by the law of nations. By cession to the
United States, the government of Mexico no longer pretended
to any control over them.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a> President Polk, differing
from other leaders of his party, held that “until Congress
shall act, the inhabitants will be without any organized government.”<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
But Congress, notwithstanding urgent appeals
of the Executive, moved very deliberately in the matter of
abolishing the office of military governor. In May, 1847,
Colonel Richard B. Mason assumed the office of Governor and
commander-in-chief of the United States forces in California.
Two months after ratification of the treaty with Mexico he
received notice of the fact, but no intimation that the civil
government instituted by the President was discontinued.
Without other instructions than an order to extend over
California “the revenue laws and tariff of the United States”
he, as well as his successor, General Riley, continued the
existing government.</p>

<p class='c000'>After affirming the legality of its institution the United
States Supreme Court (Cross <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vs.</span></i> Harrison, p. 193, 16 Howard)
says that the existing government did not cease as a
consequence of the restoration of peace; the President might
have dissolved it, but he did not do so. Congress could have
put an end to it, but that was not done. “The right inference
from the inaction of both is, that it was meant to be continued
until it had been legislatively changed.” In fact it
was so continued until the people in convention formed a
government, subsequently recognized by Congress, when California
was admitted during the autumn of 1850 as a State.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The authority, then, of both political departments, as well
as the more deliberate opinion of the judicial branch, of the
General Government had established a precedent with which
Mr. Lincoln was thoroughly familiar; for, by a singular coincidence,
both he and Mr. Johnson were serving together in
the Thirtieth Congress, which began its first session in December,
1847. They participated in, or were interested spectators
of, all those stirring scenes that marked the beginning
of one of the last legislative victories of slavery; so that this
portion at least of American history was not strange to either
the President or the Senator from Tennessee.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question whether Tennessee was within or without
the Union will be reserved for more ample discussion farther
on; it is sufficient to observe here that its territory was held
by an adverse party and its government hostile to the national
authority. If the administration of Colonel Mason and his
successor in California was not regarded by President Lincoln
as a sufficient basis for his action there was still left an
undoubted foundation. The appointment was deemed an
element of strength to the Union forces operating in Tennessee,
and, in this view, the act was entirely within the power
of the President as Commander-in-Chief of the army and
navy of the United States. Though its wisdom may be questioned
and its results dismissed with a sneer, it was not a
novelty nor can his admirers claim for Mr. Lincoln the merit
of its invention; and if in its origin the office had a bearing
on the extension, its present application was not wholly unconnected
with the abolition of slavery. The remaining pages
of this chapter and the two succeeding ones will be employed
in tracing rapidly the operation of the system of military
governors in those States in which it was seriously attempted
to be enforced.</p>

<p class='c000'>The movements of contending armies had already obliterated
in many districts of Tennessee almost every trace of civil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>government, and when State officials hurried away to Memphis,
where Governor Harris had reassembled the Legislature,
they left behind them an uncontrolled mob which General
Forrest found it necessary to charge with his cavalry to
remove a portion of Confederate military stores that had not
been distributed among the poor or perished in the prevailing
anarchy.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a> General Grant had already, on February 22, from
Fort Donelson, issued an order that “no courts will be allowed
to act under State authority, but all cases coming
within reach of the military arm will be adjudicated by the
authorities the Government has established within the State.
Martial law is therefore declared to extend over West Tennessee.”
The order added, “whenever a sufficient number of
citizens return to their allegiance to maintain law and order
over the territory, the military restriction here indicated
will be removed.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Union troops under General Nelson
having occupied the city on the 25th, Governor Johnson on
his arrival, March 12, 1862, from his seat in the United
States Senate was not under the necessity of employing the
harsh discipline of General Forrest to restore order in the
deserted capital. For this part of his career he was, however,
severely censured by political adversaries in Tennessee.
Detached from their historical settings, indeed, his acts could
justly be described as tyrannical. But it is precisely these
figures in the back-ground that are necessary to harmonize
the whole and set before us in its proper light a truthful picture
of the times. As his professions preceded his administrative
acts it is proper to introduce this portion of the subject
by quoting from a speech which he delivered in Nashville
the evening after his arrival. Five days later, March 18,
it was printed under the style of “An Appeal to the People”
of Tennessee. After some general observations on the tranquil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and prosperous existence of the State in the Union, and
on the honors by which many of her sons had been distinguished,
he noticed the fact that the very leaders of secession
themselves had been the recipients of Federal bounty and
patronage; had taken oaths to support the Constitution and
yet labored to overturn Federal authority. Entering fairly
upon his theme, he continued:</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile the State Government has disappeared. The Executive
has abdicated; the Legislature has dissolved; the Judiciary is in abeyance.
The great ship of State ... has been suddenly abandoned
by its officers and mutinous crew, and left to float at the mercy of the
winds, and to be plundered by every rover upon the deep.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pausing to enumerate many acts of spoliation, he resumes:</p>

<p class='c013'>In such a lamentable crisis the Government of the United States
could not be unmindful of its high constitutional obligation to guarantee
to every State in this Union a republican form of government, an obligation
which every State has a direct and immediate interest in having
observed towards every other State.... This obligation the national
Government is now attempting to discharge. I have been appointed,
in the absence of the regular and established State authorities,
as Military Governor for the time being, to preserve the public property
of the State, to give the protection of law actively enforced to her citizens,
and, as speedily as may be, to restore her government to the same condition
as before the existing rebellion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “regular and established State authorities,” to whom
Governor Johnson refers, were, of course, none other than
those officials who administered affairs in Tennessee before
the 6th of May. Of these some had actually abandoned their
offices, while others had subordinated their functions to a
power hostile to the constitution of the State. He proceeded:</p>

<p class='c013'>These offices must be filled temporarily, until the State shall be restored
so far to its accustomed quiet, that the people can peaceably assemble
at the ballot-box and select agents of their own choice....</p>

<p class='c013'>I shall, therefore, as early as practicable, designate for various positions
under the State and county governments, from among my fellow-citizens,
persons of probity and intelligence, and bearing true allegiance
to the Constitution and Government of the United States, who will execute
the functions of their respective offices until their places can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>filled by the action of the people. Their authority, when their appointment
shall have been made, will be accordingly respected and observed....
Those who through the dark and weary night of rebellion
have maintained their allegiance to the Federal Government will be honored.
The erring and misguided will be welcomed on their return. And
while it may become necessary, in vindicating the violated majesty of
the law, and in reasserting its imperial sway, to punish intelligent and
conscious treason in high places, no merely retaliatory or vindictive
policy will be adopted.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>To all who in private and unofficial capacity had assumed
an attitude of hostility to the Government amnesty was offered
for all past acts and declarations upon condition of yielding
obedience to the supremacy of the laws. This the Governor
advised them to do. Though the “Appeal,” brief, clear and
characterized by the best temper, is a state paper of decided
merit, there were many classes still residing at the capital
upon whom it made little impression. The mayor and the
city council were ordered to take the oath of allegiance to the
United States, and on their refusal were imprisoned. Of the
harshness of this measure it need only be observed that the
essence of government is to govern, and had the new executive
failed on this occasion to assert authority his administration
would have been wrecked at the outset. For printing
seditious matter the press was placed under restraint, and
within a few months it was found necessary to punish with
unusual severity, even ministers of the gospel. Clergymen,
with a few exceptions, were not only hostile to the Union but
actually encouraged treason from their pulpits. These
offenders Governor Johnson summoned to take the oath of
allegiance or to depart from the State. They appeared before
him, as commanded to, refused compliance, but asked
time for deliberation; this being granted, to the full extent
desired, and still persisting in their refusal they were placed
in confinement. That they were not proceeded against with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>undue haste appears from an entry in a diary kept by one of
Governor Johnson’s biographers which fixes the date as
June 28.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Three months had fully elapsed since the arrival
of Mr. Johnson before the ministers were punished for their
seditious utterances. To prevent interference with his executive
functions he sometimes imprisoned judges. Other
measures no less arbitrary have been the subject of much
criticism. He declared that whenever a loyal citizen was
maltreated five or more sympathizers with the Rebellion
should be arrested and dealt with as the nature of the case
appeared to require. When the property of Union men was
destroyed remuneration should be made them from the property
of the disloyal. The President seems to have approved
of these reprisals. Nothing more clearly shows the demoralized
condition of society in Tennessee than the necessity of
adopting measures similar to those employed eight centuries
before by the Danish and Norman conquerors of England
to protect their followers from private assassination by the
natives. With the natural leaders of the people, including
bankers, physicians and clergymen, encouraging treason, men
of inferior intelligence and station could not be expected to
remain peaceful and contented citizens, and as preachers
of sedition seldom lack numerous and sympathetic audiences
the spirit of lawlessness increased. The Governor himself
was threatened with assassination in the public streets and in
public meetings, but he set such menaces at defiance and on at
least one occasion addressed an assembly with his pistol on
a desk before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the repression of the disloyal and the restoration of
order by no means included the whole of his duties. Functions
not less important remain to be noticed. To the duties
of governor and general he added those of quartermaster
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and judge. Though thousands of loyal people flocked to
him for arms and supplies, he proved equal to every demand,
and from their number raised an army that did gallant service
in the field. He fed, clothed and sheltered the poor
without regard to the army in which their natural protectors
were serving. Thus redressing grievances, relieving want
and reinstating courts he worked with an intelligent and
tireless energy, and when the timid prudence of General Buell
would have allowed Nashville to fall into the hands of the
enemy “the courage of Governor Johnson,” said a panegyrist,
“stood a bulwark for its defence.”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a> He had been scarcely
three months in office when President Lincoln described him
as “a true and valuable man, indispensable to us in Tennessee.”
His zeal, his intense fidelity to the Union, his tremendous
energy and undoubted courage peculiarly fitted him
to rule in turbulent times. At the outset the only agencies
left for the protection of life, liberty and property were force
and arbitrary will; these he did not hesitate to employ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The foregoing account does not notice his activity in
another field. His ultimate object, the establishment of civil
authority throughout Tennessee, was kept constantly in view.
To prepare for this event he addressed in May, 1862, large
assemblies at Nashville and Murfreesboro, and in June at
Columbia and Shelbyville.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a> This work, however, was brought
suddenly to an end later in the summer by General Bragg’s
raid into Kentucky.</p>

<p class='c000'>From what has been related it appears, and the opinion
will grow stronger with the progress of this narrative, that in
appointing a military governor of Tennessee President Lincoln
intended no more than to revive an office already known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>to the people of the United States; and though Mr. Johnson
was expected ultimately to reinaugurate a loyal government
throughout the State, his office was regarded primarily as
an inexpensive means of holding territory wrested from, and
assisting in military operations against, an enemy. Indeed,
it is only in this view that his administration of the office can
be regarded as a success, and that it was so considered in the
North his nomination on the ticket with Mr. Lincoln is
undoubted proof.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides several colored regiments, the records for 1863
show that 25,000 Tennesseeans were then serving in the
Union army, and every succeeding month increased their
number.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a> That the political advantage to be gained by restoring
a loyal government was not the only or even the
principal purpose of the President may be fairly inferred from
the following letter:</p>

<p class='c013'>I am told you have at least thought of raising a negro military force.
In my opinion the country now needs no specific thing so much as some
man of your ability and position to go to this work. When I speak of
your position, I mean that of an eminent citizen of a slave state and himself
a slaveholder. The colored population is the great available and yet
un-availed of force for restoring the Union. The bare sight of 50,000
armed and drilled black soldiers upon the banks of the Mississippi would
end the rebellion at once; and who doubts that we can present that sight
if we but take hold in earnest? If you have been thinking of it, please
do not dismiss the thought.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Besides supporting the view of the military governors
taken above, this letter also makes it evident that the pressure
of events had already convinced Mr. Lincoln that to save the
Union it was necessary to possess the untrammeled use of
every national resource.</p>

<p class='c000'>As early as June 8, 1862, the State was included in the
department of General Halleck, who ten days later was requested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>by Mr. Lincoln to report any information of value
relative thereto. The thought of a movement into East
Tennessee was in the mind of the President again on June 30,
when he informed the commander that he regarded the possession
of the railroad near Cleveland fully as important as
the taking of Richmond. Halleck, concurring in this opinion,
telegraphed Buell that “the capture of East Tennessee should
be the main object of the campaign,” the department commander
believing its occupation would put an end to guerrilla
warfare both in that region and Kentucky.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inactivity of General Rosecrans for six months after
the battle of Murfreesboro left in the interior of the State a
strong Confederate force whose presence discouraged all but
the most pronounced loyalists; these, by means of meetings
and speeches, kept a latent Union feeling alive. A convention,
called by Brownlow, Maynard and others, was held at
Nashville, July 1, 1863. Delegates were in attendance from
forty counties; they took an oath of allegiance to the United
States, and in a set of resolutions pronounced the various
secession laws and ordinances void. Deeming it vitally important
to choose a legislature, they invited Governor Johnson
to issue writs of election as soon as expedient; with this
request, however, he did not then think it prudent to
comply.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other eyes were observing with interest the progress of
events within the State. General Hurlbut, writing from
Memphis, August 11, 1863, relative to the political situation
in Arkansas, said he was satisfied that Tennessee was “ready,
by overwhelming majorities, to repeal the act of secession,
establish a fair system of gradual emancipation, and tender
herself back to the Union. I have discouraged [he said] any
action on this subject here until East Tennessee is delivered.
When that is done, so that her powerful voice may be heard,
let Governor Johnson call an election for members of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Legislature, and that Legislature call a Convention, and in
sixty days the work will be done.”<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This desirable event was not long delayed, for by brilliant
though bloodless victories both Knoxville and Chattanooga
early in the following month were in possession of Federal
armies. Then President Lincoln wrote his letter of September
11, which, because of its great importance, deserves to be
reproduced in full:</p>

<p class='c013'>All Tennessee is now clear of armed insurrectionists. You need not to
be reminded that it is the nick of time for reinaugurating a loyal State
government. Not a moment should be lost. You and the coöperating
friends there can better judge of the ways and means than can be judged
by any here. I only offer a few suggestions. The reinauguration must
not be such as to give control of the State and its representation in Congress
to the enemies of the Union, driving its friends there into political
exile. The whole struggle for Tennessee will have been profitless to
both State and nation if it so ends that Governor Johnson is put down
and Governor Harris is put up. It must not be so. You must have it
otherwise. Let the reconstruction be the work of such men only as can
be trusted for the Union. Exclude all others, and trust that your government
so organized will be recognized here as being the one of republican
form to be guaranteed to the State, and to be protected against invasion
and domestic violence. It is something on the question of time to remember
that it cannot be known who is next to occupy the position I now
hold, nor what he will do. I see that you have declared in favor of
emancipation in Tennessee, for which may God bless you. Get emancipation
into your new State Government—Constitution—and there will
be no such word as fail for your case. The raising of colored troops, I
think, will greatly help every way.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c010'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The reference in this communication to emancipation is
explained by the fact that, in deference to the wishes of
Andrew Johnson and other Tennessee loyalists, the President
in his proclamation of January 1, 1863, had not mentioned
that State.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Believing that his commission as military governor did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>confer upon him powers adequate to every emergency that
might arise in the important work of restoring a loyal government
Mr. Johnson, to supply this deficiency, prepared a
letter which he submitted for the approval of President Lincoln,
who amended or modified it to read as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>In addition to the matters contained in the orders and instructions
given you by the Secretary of War, you are hereby authorized to exercise
such powers as may be necessary and proper to enable the loyal
people of Tennessee to present such a republican form of State government
as will entitle the State to the guaranty of the United States therefor,
and to be protected under such State government by the United States
against invasion and domestic violence, all according to the fourth section
of the fourth article of the Constitution of the United States.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This supplemental authority is dated September 19, and the
private letter enclosing it informs Governor Johnson why his
draft was altered.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was about this time, while the President was thus urging
Governor Johnson, that General Rosecrans, surrounded by a
victorious enemy, inquired of Mr. Lincoln whether it would
not be well “to offer a general amnesty to all officers and
soldiers in the Rebellion?” In his reply next day the President,
referring first, as was his wont, to the military situation,
added, “I intend doing something like what you suggest
whenever the case shall appear ripe enough to have it
accepted in the true understanding rather than as a confession
of weakness and fear.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c010'><sup>[31]</sup></a> The removal soon after of
General Rosecrans from his command and the fortunate appearance
at Chattanooga of those great soldiers of the first
rank, Grant, Sherman, Thomas and Sheridan, made at Lookout
Mountain and Mission Ridge the occasion which the
President so much desired, and on December 8, 1863, he
issued his famous Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction,
a copy of which was transmitted with his third annual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>message to Congress. The impression which its candid tone
produces on the mind of a student to-day was the impression
made at the time of its appearance upon thoughtful and enlightened
men everywhere. Nicolay and Hay in an interesting
chapter of their valuable history describe the satisfaction,
and even enthusiasm, with which it was received by the adherents
of all parties in Congress. This proclamation, around
which the later controversy raged, was authorized by act of
Congress approved July 17, 1862, which, among other provisions,
empowered the President “at any time” thereafter
“to extend to persons who may have participated in the
existing Rebellion in any State or part thereof, pardon and
amnesty, with such exceptions and at such time and on such
conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare.”
The time for the exercise of this discretion Mr. Lincoln believed
had now arrived. Like every measure conceived in
his fruitful mind it had been maturely considered and was
especially fortunate in being introduced by the concluding
paragraphs of the message. The very note of sincerity itself
rings in these weighty lines. Perhaps it was the suggestion
of unuttered arguments that gave a temporary adherence to
the Executive plan, which, we are told, was put forth because
“It is now desired by some persons heretofore engaged in
said rebellion to resume their allegiance to the United States,
and to reinaugurate loyal State governments within and for
their respective States.” The proclamation informed “all
persons who have, directly or by implication, participated in
the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter excepted, that a
full pardon is hereby granted to them and each of them, with
restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves, and
in property cases where rights of third parties shall have intervened,
and upon the condition that every such person
shall take and subscribe an oath, and thenceforward keep and
maintain said oath inviolate; and which oath shall be registered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>for permanent preservation.” This oath bound the
subscriber thenceforth to “faithfully support, protect, and
defend the Constitution of the United States, and the union
of the States thereunder”; to “abide by and faithfully support
all acts of Congress passed during the existing rebellion
with reference to slaves” unless repealed, modified or held
void by Congress, or by decision of the Supreme Court; to
support “all proclamations of the President made during the
existing rebellion having reference to slaves, so long and so
far as not modified or declared void by decision of the Supreme
Court.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The classes excepted from the benefits of the amnesty were
all persons “who are, or shall have been, civil or diplomatic
officers or agents of the so-called Confederate Government;
all who have left judicial stations under the United States
to aid the rebellion; all who are, or shall have been, military
or naval officers of said so-called Confederate Government
above the rank of colonel in the army or lieutenant in the
navy; all who left seats in the United States Congress to
aid the rebellion; all who resigned commissions in the
Army or Navy of the United States and afterward aided the
rebellion; and all who have engaged in any way in treating
colored persons, or white persons in charge of such, otherwise
than lawfully as prisoners of war, and which persons
may have been found in the United States service, as soldiers,
seamen, or in any other capacity.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The proclamation provided further that whenever, in any
of the States in rebellion, “a number of persons, not less than
one tenth in number of the votes cast in such State at the
presidential election” of 1860, “each having taken the oath
aforesaid and not having since violated it, and being a qualified
voter by the election law of the State existing immediately
before the so-called act of secession, and excluding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>all others, shall reëstablish a State government which shall
be republican, and in nowise contravening said oath, such shall
be recognized as the true government of the State and the
State shall receive thereunder the benefits of the Constitutional
provision which declares that ‘The United States
shall guaranty to every State in this Union a republican form
of Government, and shall protect each of them against invasion;
and, on application of the legislature, or of the executive
(when the legislature cannot be convened), against domestic
violence.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>Any provision adopted by such State relative to its freed
people “which shall recognize and declare their permanent
freedom, provide for their education, and which may yet be
consistent as a temporary arrangement with their present
condition as a laboring, landless, and homeless class, will not
be objected to by the national executive.” In constructing a
loyal government in any State, it was thought not improper
to suggest that “the name of the State, the boundary, the
subdivisions, the constitution, and the general code of laws, as
before the rebellion, be maintained, subject only to the modifications
made necessary by the conditions hereinbefore stated,
and such others, if any, not contravening said conditions,
and which may be deemed expedient by those framing the
new State government.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To avoid every occasion of misunderstanding it was expressly
stated that the proclamation “has no reference to
States wherein loyal State governments have all the while
been maintained.” The President disclaimed any authority
to admit members to seats in Congress, each House being
“the judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its
own members.”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c010'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In conclusion it was observed that “while the mode presented
is the best the executive can suggest, with his present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>impressions, it must not be understood that no other possible
mode would be acceptable.”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c010'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>To get an enrollment of those willing to take the oath
prescribed in the amnesty proclamation the President, about
the middle of January, 1864, sent an agent to Tennessee, as
he had already sent one to Louisiana and to Arkansas. About
the same time Governor Johnson himself was considering
the subject of reconstruction; and on the 21st, to begin proceedings,
called a public meeting at Nashville. It was on this
occasion that he said: “Treason must be made odious,
traitors must be punished and impoverished;” slavery he
pronounced dead and declared that reconstruction must leave
it out of view. The meeting, which was largely attended,
adopted resolutions recommending a constitutional convention
and pledged support of only those candidates who favored
immediate and universal emancipation. The Governor, however,
was cautious, and, January 26, 1864, issued a call for an
election, on the first Saturday of March following, for the
choice of only county officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ex-Confederate and the loyalist having been placed
by the amnesty proclamation on an equal footing, some dissatisfaction
was aroused among unconditional Union men.
To retain the confidence of this class and to set at rest the
hostile feeling thus excited in the State, Governor Johnson
framed the oath of allegiance more stringently than Mr. Lincoln
had done. This variance occasioned discussion and
delay and brought inquiries and protests to the President,
who, to prevent confusion, telegraphed, February 20, 1864,
Warren Jordan, of Nashville, as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>In county elections you had better stand by Governor Johnson’s
plan; otherwise you will have conflict and confusion. I have seen his
plan.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c010'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>A week later he assured the Hon. E. H. East, Secretary of
State for Tennessee, that</p>

<p class='c013'>There is no conflict between the oath of amnesty in my proclamation
of eighth December, 1863, and that prescribed by Governor Johnson in
his proclamation of the twenty-sixth ultimo.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c010'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>While it is perfectly true that no discrepancy existed between
the proclamation of the President and that of the
military governor, the latter required an additional test. This
the communication to Mr. East does not discuss.</p>

<p class='c000'>To avoid, however, any possible mischief from this source
Mr. Lincoln, March 26, issued a supplemental proclamation
which explained that the amnesty applied only to “persons
who being yet at large and free from any arrest, confinement,
or duress, shall voluntarily come forward and take the said
oath, with the purpose of restoring peace and establishing
the national authority.”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c010'><sup>[37]</sup></a> Prisoners excluded from the amnesty
offered in the proclamation of December 8, like all other
offenders, might apply to the executive for clemency and have
their applications receive due consideration. This oath, it
was made known, could be taken before any commissioned
officer of the United States, civil, military or naval, or before
any officer authorized to administer oaths, in a State or
Territory not in insurrection. Such officers were empowered
to give certificates thereon to persons by whom the oath was
taken and subscribed. The original records, after transmission
to the Department of State, were to be there deposited
and to remain in the Government archives. The Secretary of
State was required to keep a register of such oaths and upon
application to issue certificates in proper cases in the customary
form.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile an election, the returns of which are extremely
meagre, had been held on March 5 for the choice of county
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>officers. Though the event was not without influence in
confirming the faith of Unionists, it was chiefly of value in
attracting the attention of the disloyal to the chances afforded
by the proclamation of rehabilitating themselves in their
former political rights. The result, however, was not so
favorable as was expected by Governor Johnson or the
President, and reconstruction in Tennessee once more sank
to rest. From this condition it was again revived by the
irrepressible Union men of the State. The East Tennessee
convention of 1861, by appointing a permanent committee,
had kept its organization alive. In April or May, 1864, this
body called a convention at Knoxville to discuss reconstruction.
Of this gathering one element favored the Crittenden
Resolutions; the other, immediate emancipation. Probably it
was this antagonism that prevented further action. The next
we hear is that Brownlow and others signed a call for a second
convention, which was held at Nashville on September 5.
In this body forty or fifty counties were represented, some
of them irregularly; that is, by volunteer delegates. This
assembly recommended the election of a constitutional convention,
the abolition of slavery in the State, and provided for
taking part in the approaching Presidential election. The
programme, however, was only partially carried out. On
September 30, Governor Johnson issued a proclamation for
holding the election, at which Union voters, so far as the
unsettled condition of military operations permitted, cast
their ballots for electors of President and Vice-President.
It does not appear that in this election any attempt was made
to choose a governor, a legislature or a constitutional convention;
but that which met in July, 1863, constituted an executive
committee, composed of five members from each division
of the State, which after the Presidential election issued calls
for a State convention at Nashville, December 19, 1864.
“The people meet,” said the call, “to take such steps as wisdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>may direct to restore the State of Tennessee to its once
honored status in the great national Union.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'>“If you cannot meet in your counties, come upon your own
personal responsibility. It is the assembling of Union men
for the restoration of their own commonwealth to life and a
career of success.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Hood’s advance upon Nashville preventing a response to
this address, the convention did not meet till January 9, 1865.
The enemy had then been dispersed. The State being free
from further alarms of war, the convention met and proposed
important alterations in the State constitution.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first article provided: “That slavery and involuntary
servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party
shall have been duly convicted, are hereby forever abolished
and prohibited throughout the State”; also that “The legislature
shall make no law recognizing the right of property in
man.” The old constitution of Tennessee prohibited the assembly
from passing laws to emancipate slaves without the
consent of the owner; that prohibition was now removed.
“The declaration of independence and ordinance dissolving
the federal relations between the State of Tennessee and the
United States of America,” passed by the Legislature, May 6,
1861, was abrogated and declared “an act of treason and
usurpation, unconstitutional, null and void.” All laws, ordinances,
and resolutions of the usurped State government
passed on and after the 6th day of May, 1861, providing for
the issuance of State bonds; also all notes of the Bank of
Tennessee or any of its branches issued on or after May 6,
1861, and all debts created in the name of the State by
said authority were declared unconstitutional, null and void.
Future legislatures were restrained from the redemption of
said bonds. It was further provided that “The qualification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>of voters and the limitation of the elective franchise may be
determined by the general assembly, which shall first assemble
under the amended constitution.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The convention completed its labors on January 26, 1865.
The amendatory articles were submitted, February 22, to the
people, and ratified by a vote of 21,104 to 40. The schedule
provided in the event of ratification that the loyal people of
the State should, on the 4th of March next thereafter, proceed
by <em>general ticket</em> to elect a governor and members to the
general assembly to meet in the capitol at Nashville on the
first Monday of April, 1865.</p>

<p class='c000'>A proclamation of Governor Johnson, issued on January
26, referred to the respectable character of the convention and
commended its wisdom in submitting for the approval of the
electors the result of its deliberations. His executive powers
had been employed to enable the people freely to express their
judgment on the grave question before them. Provision, he
declared, would be made to collect the sentiments of loyal
Tennesseeans in the army. The paper concludes with this
vigorous exhortation: “Strike down at one blow the institution
of slavery, remove the disturbing element from your
midst, and by united action restore the State to its ancient
moorings again, and you may confidently expect the speedy
return of peace, happiness, and prosperity.”<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>About a month later, February 25, he had the happiness to
congratulate the people of Tennessee on the favorable result
of the election. By their solemn act at the ballot-box the
shackles had been stricken from the limbs of more than
275,000 bondmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The convention which proposed the constitutional amendments
had, in anticipation of its ratification, nominated William
G. [“Parson”] Brownlow for Governor, and recommended
a full legislative ticket. The nominee of the convention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>was chosen March 4, almost without opposition, receiving
23,352 votes against 35 scattering. Having been elected
on a general ticket the members of both the Senate and House
of Representatives received the same support as the Governor.
The Legislature met at Nashville, and in a few days thereafter
Mr. Brownlow was inaugurated. Civil administration
was thus formally begun.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the successive steps to restoration in Tennessee may
be easily traced, the narrative has not been interrupted to relate
even matters of undoubted importance. Almost a year before
the occurrences described, the Republican national convention
had assembled in the city of Baltimore, and on June 6, 1864,
unanimously nominated Andrew Johnson for Vice-President
on the ticket with Mr. Lincoln. Tidings of the fact aroused
great enthusiasm when it became known in Nashville. In
addressing an immense meeting called for that occasion Governor
Johnson, among other things, said: “While society is
in this disordered state, and we are seeking security, let us fix
the foundations of our government on principles of eternal
justice, which will endure for all time. There are those in
our midst who are for perpetuating the institution of slavery.
Let me say to you, Tennesseeans, and men from the Northern
States, that slavery is dead. It was not murdered by me. I
told you long ago what the result would be if you endeavored
to go out of the Union to save slavery; and that the result
would be bloodshed, rapine, devastated fields, plundered villages
and cities; and therefore I urged you to remain in the
Union. In trying to save slavery you killed it, and lost your
own freedom.”<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In his letter to Hon. William Dennison, accepting the nomination,
he wrote:</p>

<p class='c013'>The authority of the Government is supreme, and will admit of no
rivalry. No institution can rise above it whether it be slavery or any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>organized power. In our happy form of government all must be subordinate
to the will of the people, when reflected through the Constitution
and the laws made pursuant thereto—State or Federal. This great principle
lies at the foundation of every government, and cannot be disregarded
without the destruction of the government itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>In accepting the nomination I might here close, but I cannot forego
the opportunity of saying to my old friends of the Democratic party
<em>proper</em>, with whom I have so long and pleasantly been associated, that
the hour has now come when that great party can justly vindicate its devotion
to true democratic policy and measures of expediency. The war
is a war of great principles. It involves the supremacy and life of the
Government itself. If the rebellion triumphs, free government—North
and South—fails. If, on the other hand, the Government is successful,
as I do not doubt, its destiny is fixed, its basis permanent and enduring,
and its career of honor and glory just begun. In a great contest like
this, for the existence of free government, the path of duty is patriotism
and principle. Minor considerations and questions of administrative
policy should give way to the higher duty <em>of first preserving the Government</em>,
and then there will be time enough to wrangle over the men and
measures pertaining to its administration.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c010'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>For reasons at which Mr. Lincoln hinted in his letter of
March 26, 1863, few men in Congress exerted in the beginning
of the war so decided an influence upon public opinion
in the North as did Mr. Johnson. His conduct as military
governor in no way diminished this popularity. His courage
in that trying position no less than his devotion to the interests
of the Union won him ardent admirers in every loyal State.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vice-President Hamlin appears to have been the victim of
an intrigue which represented him as being no material source
of strength to the government and as scarcely loyal to the administration.
This injurious suspicion, which seems to have
had no substantial basis in truth, happened to coincide with
a growing conviction that the Republican party should
strengthen itself by placing on the ticket with Lincoln some
prominent leader of the opposition. In this connection the
names of General Butler, John A. Dix, Daniel S. Dickinson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>and Andrew Johnson were mentioned. The last named was
charged in his administration of the office of military governor
with harshness and even with oppression. Investigation
proved these rumors to be without foundation, and
Mr. Lincoln was not displeased to find them groundless.
It does not appear that he was especially favorable to Johnson,
but he regarded him as indispensable to the Union cause
in Tennessee; Johnson was a slave-holder, was somewhat
more outspoken than Butler or Dix, and a more conspicuous
representative of the large class known as War Democrats;
above all he was an able exponent of Southern Union sentiment
and he came from the very heart of the Confederacy.
Perhaps no single element of strength made him more acceptable
to the majority of the convention than this last consideration.
Even these qualifications might not have singled
him out for the distinction conferred were it not for the enthusiasm
created by a remarkable speech of Horace Maynard,
which mentioned Mr. Johnson as a man who “stood in the
furnace of treason.” His administration as military governor
had been distinguished for vigor and ability, and it does
not appear that the radical Republicans then regarded his
State without the Union. Some of his measures were undoubtedly
severe, but the peculiar situation in Tennessee required
the employment of methods not adapted to times of
peace. Mr. Lincoln could not, of course, show his hand in
the Baltimore convention. In fact he repeatedly declined to
interfere.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c010'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On October 15, 1864, the ten electors on the McClellan
ticket presented through Mr. John Lellyett, one of their number,
a protest to the President against the proclamation published
by Governor Johnson relative to the pending election.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>His paper, they asserted, contained provisions for holding elections
which differed materially from the mode prescribed by
the laws of Tennessee. The proclamation, it was alleged,
would admit persons to vote who were not entitled by the
State constitution to participate in the election; by another provision
which authorized the opening of but one polling-place
in each county, many legal voters would be unable to exercise
the franchise. The unusual and impracticable test oath proposed,
was stated as a further grievance, and they complained
generally of military interference with the freedom of elections.
To their representations Mr. Lincoln replied orally
that General McClellan and his friends could manage their
side of the contest in their own way. He could manage his
side of it in his way.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c010'><sup>[43]</sup></a> In a written reply of the 22d, however,
the President said that he perceived no military reason
for interfering in the matter, and on the same occasion reminded
the protestants that the conducting of a Presidential
election in Tennessee under the old code had become an impossibility.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c010'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In their reply to the written communication of the President,
they asserted that an orderly meeting of General McClellan’s
friends had been broken up by Union soldiers, and
a reign of terror inaugurated in Nashville. These acts having
been countenanced by Governor Johnson, they announced
the withdrawal of the McClellan electoral ticket in Tennessee.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c010'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In these circumstances the Union electors were, of course,
chosen; but their votes, though offered, were not counted by
Congress in the joint convention of February 8, 1865, for
the reason that Tennessee was on November 8 preceding in
such a state that no free election was held.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c010'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The first movement toward reconstruction in Louisiana,
as in the case of Tennessee, was bound up with the
war powers of the President, and, no doubt, was made
with some expectation of aiding his military plans. The
thought of restoring a loyal government there proceeded quite
naturally from the peculiar situation in the State. Though
not so nearly unanimous for secession as South Carolina, her
people acted with energy and promptness when they received
tidings of “this last insult and outrage,” as the election of
Mr. Lincoln was sensationally styled.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c010'><sup>[47]</sup></a> Three days were
deemed sufficient for deliberation, and the convention, January
25, 1861, passed an ordinance of secession. Two weeks before
this assembly met at Baton Rouge, the arsenal and the
forts, a public building and a revenue cutter had been seized
by State troops from New Orleans. In the mint and the custom
house of that city more than half a million dollars was
secured for the Confederate States, and in accepting these
funds the Montgomery Congress expressed its “high sense
of the patriotic liberality” of Louisiana.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c010'><sup>[48]</sup></a> This act of generosity,
however, loses much of its merit when it is remembered
that both the coin and bullion in the mint, as well as the
customs, belonged to the Federal government. Besides, there
was then no scarcity of money in the State, for Northern
enterprise had found for her cotton and her sugar profitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>markets both at home and abroad. It was benefits of
this sort, enjoyed in the Union, that enabled Governor Moore
in January, 1861, to report to his Legislature an overflowing
treasury.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c010'><sup>[49]</sup></a> This undoubted prosperity served only to aggravate
the war fever. Enthusiasm in New Orleans was only
less ardent and general than in Charleston. Business was almost
suspended, and by the first of June no less than 16,000
residents of Louisiana were serving in the Confederate army.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c010'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>President Lincoln’s proclamation of April 19 preceding
had inaugurated a blockade of every port within the State.
The early days of July witnessed the disappearance of Governor
Moore’s boasted surplus, and during the summer New
Orleans became bankrupt;<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c010'><sup>[51]</sup></a> her foreign commerce was destroyed
by the blockade, her credit had vanished. Though
enlistments continued without interruption, signs of financial
distress multiplied with the approach of winter. Rebellion,
it was soon discovered, was not attended with unmixed blessings;
bad government had produced its usual consequences,
and when Governor Taylor, late in the summer of 1862, undertook
to raise an army for the defence of his State he was
surprised at the universal apathy; neglect and disaster had
brought disunionists to a condition little short of hostility
to the Richmond government.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c010'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Union men in southern Louisiana had not been unobservant
of these signs; permanent residents of this portion of the
State had, for the most part, maintained their loyalty to the
General Government. Indeed, a decided majority of them
in the election of 1860 had voted for Bell and Douglas, and
though here, as elsewhere in the South, ardent secessionists
were found, the proceedings in the convention took the Union
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>men by surprise.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c010'><sup>[53]</sup></a> In the interval they had refrained from
violence, but had not become reconciled to oppression.</p>

<p class='c000'>The importance of New Orleans to their cause had not
been overlooked by Confederate authorities, and that city was
held firmly in their grasp until the fleet of Captain Farragut,
toward the close of April, 1862, steamed up in hostile array
before its defences. The occupation by General Butler’s
army of this strategic position ended in southern Louisiana
the activity of the more extreme secessionists, and though
some restlessness at the presence of Federal forces was pretended
by even Union men, they had not until the surrender
made any serious effort to help themselves. Under protection
of the army, however, they commenced immediately to
form Union associations for the purpose of developing the
loyal sentiment in this part of the State. Resolutions recommending
an election were passed by these organizations;
newspapers discussed the question, and in various ways it
was forced upon the attention of the President.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c010'><sup>[54]</sup></a> The more
prudent and intelligent among them began under encouragement
of Federal troops to consider measures for relief; the
less practical commenced writing complaints to friends in the
North.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a private letter of July 26, 1862, to Hon. Reverdy
Johnson, then in New Orleans investigating General Butler’s
relations with foreign consuls, Mr. Lincoln, noticing a reference
to the restlessness of the people under the rule of General
Phelps, asks the Maryland Senator to pardon him for
believing the complaint “a false pretense.” A way to avert
the inconveniences arising from military occupation was for
the people of Louisiana “simply to take their place in the
Union upon the old terms.”<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c010'><sup>[55]</sup></a> Writing two days later to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Cuthbert Bullett, a Southern gentleman who appears to have
enjoyed his personal esteem and confidence, the President,
after mentioning difficulties in the way of establishing civil
authority in the State, suggested a method of avoiding them:
“The people of Louisiana who wish protection to person and
property,” he wrote, “have but to reach forth their hands and
take it. Let them in good faith reinaugurate the national
authority, and set up a State government conforming thereto
under the Constitution. They know how to do it, and can
have the protection of the army while doing it. The army will
be withdrawn so soon as such State government can dispense
with its presence; and the people of the State can then, upon
the old constitutional terms, govern themselves to their own
liking.”<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c010'><sup>[56]</sup></a> If, however, Union men exerted themselves no
further than criticism of the Federal Government, it was
more than intimated that there were to be expected greater
injuries than military necessity had yet inflicted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pressure of events appears even then to have been
forcing the President in the direction of emancipation. To
August Belmont, of New York, who enclosed the complaints
of a New Orleans correspondent, Mr. Lincoln, July 31, 1862,
repeated in substance what had already been written to Mr.
Bullett, and added: “Those enemies must understand that
they cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy the
government, and if they fail still come back into the Union
unhurt. If they expect in any contingency to ever have the
Union as it was, I join with the writer [Mr. Belmont’s correspondent]
in saying, ‘Now is the time.’”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c010'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The appointment in August, 1862, of General George F.
Shepley as military governor may be regarded as the first
act in the restoration of a loyal government for Louisiana.
His selection, though probably intended as a private commendation
of the judgment of General Butler, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>already designated him as Mayor of New Orleans, was never
considered by that officer adequate atonement for the public
censure implied in his removal, December, 1862, from command
of the Department of the Gulf.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the Federal occupation of New Orleans and adjacent
territory all functions of the disloyal government therein immediately
ceased. As controversies were constantly arising
the establishment of courts had become a necessity. At first
these questions were for the most part adjudicated by General
Butler himself, but the pressure of military and other affairs
compelled him soon to refer their settlement to civilians or to
army officers especially chosen for the purpose. This uncertain
system of justice, though immeasurably better than none,
led to the institution of courts each of which was known by
the name of the officer holding it. Accused persons were
brought to trial, and judgments executed by soldiers detailed
for such duty. No formal record of proceedings in these
tribunals appears to have been kept, though memoranda of
judgments rendered were, no doubt, made by an officer who
came eventually to be designated as clerk.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the decision of questions relating exclusively to the
force under his command General Butler some time in June,
1862, organized a tribunal known as the Provost Court of
the Army of the United States, over which Major Joseph M.
Bell presided. Questions in no way connected with the military,
especially matters of police and the punishment of
crimes, were often submitted for its determination. Aggrieved
persons, without reflecting upon the consequence of
their acts, naturally appealed for redress to the holder of
power. Thus the authority of this institution silently extended,
and by the autumn of 1862 it exercised unquestioned
jurisdiction over all criminal cases arising in the city of New
Orleans.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c010'><sup>[58]</sup></a> In the absence of courts for adjudicating civil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>questions they, too, were referred to its consideration. All
functions of government having been suspended by the capture
of the city, it became the duty of the Federal commander,
and his right by the laws of war, to provide, among other
things, for the administration of justice.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the early acts of General Shepley after his appointment
as Military Governor was to establish a system of
courts for the State. Most of the former officials having
fled after the surrender, he was compelled practically to
create new tribunals, and this task he greatly simplified by
reviving those institutions of justice with which the people
of Louisiana were already familiar. John S. Whittaker was
accordingly appointed Judge of the Second District Court
of the parish of Orleans. Besides possessing in civil matters
the ordinary powers of a local court the old tribunal of that
name had been a court of probates and successions. The new
exercised all the powers of the old court. It should be remembered,
however, that the latter derived its authority from
the laws of Louisiana, while the former owed its existence to
the war powers of the Federal Executive. Its jurisdiction
extended to civil cases generally where the defendant resided
in the parish of Orleans or was a non-resident of the State.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c010'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Judge Hiestand was appointed to the bench of the Fourth
District Court of the parish of Orleans. Besides possessing
the general authority of other district courts in that parish it
entertained appeals from justices’ courts; indeed, these constituted
a large part of its business.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c010'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Sixth District Court of the parish of Orleans, revived
soon after the capture of the city, is, because of the incumbent
of that bench, Judge Rufus K. Howell, of greater interest
than either of the preceding. Under a commission received
from the State of Louisiana before its attempted secession he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>continued to preside over that tribunal while the disunion
party ruled New Orleans, and performed his functions up
to the very hour of its surrender to the Federal authorities.
Having early taken the oath of allegiance to the national
Government he was permitted to resume his functions.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c010'><sup>[61]</sup></a> Like
the tribunals mentioned, this court retained and exercised
all the powers that it possessed as originally constituted.</p>

<p class='c000'>These courts, instituted during September and October,
1862, entered upon the discharge of their duties about the 1st
of November following. They were the only tribunals of
civil jurisdiction in Louisiana, and that jurisdiction was
limited, as against defendants resident of the State, to citizens
of the parish of Orleans. As to inhabitants beyond the limits
of that parish there was no court in which they could be
sued. Though the Federal forces held several counties in
this condition, their tenure fluctuated with the fortunes of
war. A court was therefore needed whose jurisdiction would
expand with the advance, and contract with the retreat, of
the Union armies. The Provost Court was not deemed adequate,
and indeed was never designed to meet such contingencies.
To supply this deficiency a tribunal of very extensive
powers, designated as “a court of record for the State
of Louisiana,” was constituted by Executive order on October
20. Of this flexible institution Charles A. Peabody, of New
York, a friend of Secretary Seward, was made provisional
judge. Besides being empowered to select a prosecuting attorney,
a marshal and a clerk, and to make rules for the exercise
of his jurisdiction, he was authorized “to hear, try and
determine all causes, civil and criminal, including causes in
law, equity, revenue and admiralty, and particularly all such
powers and jurisdiction as belong to the District and Circuit
Courts of the United States, conforming his proceedings, so
far as possible, to the course of proceedings and practice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>which has been customary in the Courts of the United States
and Louisiana—his judgment to be final and conclusive.”
These officers were to be paid out of the contingent fund of
the War Department, and a copy of the Executive order,
certified by the Secretary of War, was “held to be a sufficient
commission” for the Judge.</p>

<p class='c000'>This institution, made up as to its <em>personnel</em> in the North,
was sent from New York with the great expedition of General
Banks constituted and organized for immediate business to
Louisiana. Though Judge Peabody, accompanied by Augustus
de B. Hughes, Isaac Edward Clarke and George D. Lamont,
who had been chosen, respectively, clerk, marshal and
prosecuting attorney, arrived in New Orleans December 15,
1862, the opening of court was delayed till the 29th of
that month by a change of administration in that Department.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c010'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the tribunals described many other courts
were established about this time; of these the Supreme Court
of Louisiana is the only one which appears to require especial
mention. In former times under the State judicial system
appeals had lain to this institution, and it was accordingly
held that decisions of the courts now created were subject
to its revision. In this manner many of their judgments were
stayed and in suspense, so that the new district courts were of
little practical benefit. The necessity of a tribunal to remedy
this deficiency and adjudicate the accumulated cases of former
years soon became apparent, and in April, 1863, Mr. Peabody
was appointed Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court;
associated with him on this bench were judges chosen from
among the people of Louisiana.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly a week before his appointment of Judge Peabody,
Mr. Lincoln, by the hand of Hon. John E. Bouligny, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>not left his seat in the House of Representatives when Southern
delegations withdrew from Congress, sent to General
Butler, Governor Shepley and other Federal officers having
authority under the United States in Louisiana a communication
requesting each of them to assist Mr. Bouligny in his
effort to secure “peace again upon the old terms under the
Constitution of the United States.”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c010'><sup>[63]</sup></a> This desirable end
was to be attained by the election of “members to the Congress
of the United States particularly, and perhaps a legislature,
State officers, and United States senators friendly to
their object.” Federal officers were instructed to give the
people a chance to express their wishes at these elections.
“Follow forms of law,” wrote the President, “as far as convenient,
but at all events get the expression of the largest
number of the people possible. All see how such action will
connect with and affect the proclamation of September 22.
Of course the men elected should be gentlemen of character,
willing to swear support to the Constitution, as of old, and
known to be above reasonable suspicion of duplicity.”<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c010'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Loyal leaders, believing that Northern men holding office
under the General Government in Louisiana would be set up
as candidates, communicated their fears to the President, who
sent to Governor Shepley a fortnight before the election a
letter of which the essential portion is as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>We do not particularly need members of Congress from there to enable
us to get along with legislation here. What we do want is the conclusive
evidence that respectable citizens of Louisiana are willing to be
members of Congress and to swear support to the Constitution and that
other respectable citizens there are willing to vote for them and send
them. To send a parcel of Northern men here as representatives, elected,
as would be understood (and perhaps really so), at the point of the bayonet,
would be disgusting and outrageous; and were I a member of
Congress here, I would vote against admitting any such man to a seat.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c010'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>The note of sincerity is unmistakable throughout, and in
those Representatives and Senators opposed to Executive
policy the concluding sentences especially must have excited
strange emotions when they re-read in after years their impassioned
attacks in Congress upon that dark spirit who,
it was gravely alleged, labored with might unquestioned to
subordinate the Legislative branch of Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Union associations referred to appointed committees
who waited upon General Shepley and demanded an election.
This he hesitated to call until considerable pressure had first
been exerted. The sentiments of the President concurring
with the local feeling in New Orleans, Shepley finally yielded,
and on November 14, 1862, issued a proclamation for an
election to be held December 3d following. This election, in
the language of his proclamation, was ordered “for the purpose
of securing to the loyal electors” of both the First
and Second Congressional Districts “their appropriate and
lawful representation in the House of Representatives of the
United States of America, and of enabling them to avail
themselves of the benefits secured by the proclamation of the
President of the United States to the people of any State, or
part of a State, who shall on the first day of January next
be in good faith represented in the Congress of the United
States, by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a
majority of the qualified voters of such State have participated.”<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c010'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the qualifications prescribed by the laws of
Louisiana, General Shepley required each elector to take an
oath of allegiance to the United States, and from among
the old and respected citizens of the State appointed sheriffs
and commissioners of election, who performed their duties
to the entire satisfaction of both candidates and voters. The
army, for reasons given above, refrained from all manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>of interference, and no Federal office-holder was a
nominee.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the first time in many years, it was admitted, every
qualified elector might freely cast his ballot without fear
of intimidation or violence. In a total of 2,643 votes Benjamin
F. Flanders was chosen, with little opposition, for the
First, and Michael Hahn, by a safe majority, for the Second
Congressional District. A larger vote was actually cast for
Flanders than had been received by his predecessor, and in
both districts 7,760 citizens, or about half the usual number,
appeared at the polls. When it is remembered that four thousand
soldiers who enlisted in Butler’s army from this part
of the State did not participate in the contest, that many
citizens from this section were serving in the Confederate
army and that not a few Union men were exiles in the North
or in Europe the vote in this election was by no means light.</p>

<p class='c000'>With credentials signed by Governor Shepley, Messrs.
Hahn and Flanders appeared in Washington as claimants for
seats in Congress. After a thorough investigation of the
election and several ingenious arguments in opposition both
were admitted, February 17, 1863, though not without considerable
misgiving, as Representatives for the remainder of
the term, which expired March 3 following. For their exclusion
the opposition relied mainly upon these grounds:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>First.</em> The election, it was asserted, was brought about by
a threat of interference with slave property if the State was
not represented in Congress by January 1, 1863; this was a
measure of coercion, and the compliance of citizens in appearing
at the polls was ascribed to selfish motives rather than to
loyal and patriotic sentiments.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Second.</em> The existence of any vacancy in a constitutional
sense was at least doubtful; and even if vacancies existed in
these districts the authority of a military governor to call an
election was denied.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span><em>Third.</em> It was objected that Governor Shepley had dispensed
with the registry required by law and had empowered
commissioners of election to decide upon the qualifications of
voters; finally, by requiring an oath of allegiance to the
United States, he had imposed upon electors a test unknown
to the laws of Louisiana.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c010'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>While the cases of Messrs. Hahn and Flanders were pending
the edict of freedom had gone forth, for the President,
as announced in his preliminary proclamation of September
22, had declared, January 1, 1863, “as a fit and necessary
war measure,” that “all persons held as slaves within said
designated States and parts of States, are and henceforward
shall be free.”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c010'><sup>[68]</sup></a> Louisiana was named as one of the States
in rebellion. From the operation of this measure, however,
the city of New Orleans and thirteen parishes of the State
were excepted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The admission, February 17, of Hahn and Flanders gave
new life to the political reorganization of the State.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c010'><sup>[69]</sup></a> But
with this revival of interest there was discovered among
the supporters of the Federal Government a difference of
opinion as to the best course to be pursued in the circumstances.
This division of sentiment arose concerning the wisdom
of retaining slavery in those parishes not included in the
President’s proclamation. The Union associations, each appointing
five delegates, organized what they termed a Free
State General Committee with Thomas J. Durant as president.
This body, holding anti-slavery views and assuming
that rebellion had destroyed the fundamental law, took measures
to elect delegates to a general convention for the purpose
of framing a new constitution prohibiting slavery.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Their plan was approved by General Shepley, who, June 12,
1863, appointed Mr. Durant Attorney-General for the State,
with power to act as commissioner of registration.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c010'><sup>[70]</sup></a> He was
ordered on the same day to make an enrollment of all free
white male citizens of the United States having resided
six months in the State and one month in the parish, who
should each take the oath of allegiance and register “as a
voter freely and voluntarily for the purpose of organizing a
State government in Louisiana, loyal to the Government of
the United States.”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c010'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The conservative element, though less active, was by no
means indifferent to these measures, and sent to Washington
a committee of planters to consult the President. They
represented in a communication to him that they had “been
delegated to seek of the General Government a full recognition
of all the rights of the State as they existed previous to
the passage of an act of secession, upon the principle of the
existence of the State constitution unimpaired, and no legal
act having transpired that could in any way deprive them of
the advantages conferred by that constitution.” They further
requested him to direct the Military Governor to order an
election on the first Monday of November following for all
State and Federal officers.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c010'><sup>[72]</sup></a> To this committee, composed of
E. E. Malhiot, Bradish Johnson and Thomas Cottman, Mr.
Lincoln, under date of June 19, 1863, replied “that a respectable
portion of the Louisiana people desired to amend their
State constitution, and contemplated holding a State convention
for that object. This fact alone, as it seems to me, is a
sufficient reason why the General Government should not
give the committal you seek to the existing State constitution.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>I may add that while I do not perceive how such committal
could facilitate our military operations in Louisiana, I really
apprehend it might be so used as to embarrass them.”<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c010'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is evident, when we recall the letter of July 26, 1862, to
Reverdy Johnson, that the President, then only contemplating
emancipation, had, since his proclamation had gone forth,
taken much more advanced ground.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c010'><sup>[74]</sup></a> The army was still
his main reliance, and the wisdom of restoring a loyal government
as well as the method of that restoration was regarded
favorably or otherwise as it appeared to facilitate or embarrass
military operations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Relative to an election in November he said, “There is
abundant time without any order or proclamation from me
just now.” Though their request was courteously denied,
he assured the committee that the people of Louisiana should
not lack an opportunity for a fair election for both Federal
and State officers by want of anything within his power to
give them.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c010'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The political reorganization of the State was at this point
interrupted by the absence at Port Hudson of General N. P.
Banks, then in command of the Department of the Gulf. So
energetic and successful was the Confederate General Taylor
that by July 10, when he received intelligence of the fall of
Port Hudson and the surrender of Vicksburg, his mounted
scouts had been pushed to within sixteen miles of New Orleans.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c010'><sup>[76]</sup></a>
The surrender in these strongholds of more than 40,000
men was a crushing blow to the Richmond Government;
enough troops were disengaged by these victories to overwhelm
the enemy that menaced New Orleans, and General
Taylor hurriedly concentrated his army in the valley of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Red River to observe the movements of the Federal commander.
The Union picket line marked at this time the
bounds of Governor Shepley’s civil jurisdiction; indeed, it
was not greatly extended until the surrender of General
E. Kirby Smith late in May, 1865, after the engagement at
Brazos. Eastern Louisiana, with Alabama and Mississippi,
had passed a few weeks earlier under Federal control.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great numbers withdrawn from production in the
South combined with a rigorous enforcement of the blockade
had occasioned a cotton famine in the markets of the world.
To relieve this condition an outlet was sought for the abundant
crops of the Red River country; and this fact was probably,
not without considerable influence, in determining the
course of the expedition into Texas, which was intended
to accomplish a very different though scarcely less important
purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the vigilance of Mr. Adams, United States Minister
to England, was rewarded by the abandonment in that
country of any further attempt to build cruisers of the Alabama
type, the Confederate naval agent by no means despaired
of dealing still severer blows to the commerce of
the North, and, attracted by promises which appear to have
been authorized by the ruler of France, changed his field of
activity from Liverpool to Bordeaux, where a ship-builder
was engaged to construct two formidable rams. With the
attempts to get these under the Confederate flag this essay
is not concerned.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c010'><sup>[77]</sup></a> French interests in Mexico appeared at
that time to require the cultivation of friendly relations with
what some European States believed was destined to become
a new power among the nations of the world; hence
Napoleon’s encouragement to the Confederate representatives
abroad. This situation was so seriously regarded by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Government at Washington that even at considerable sacrifice
it was determined to plant the Union flag somewhere in
Texas. To effect this object General Banks had considered
and submitted to the War Department plans of his own;
these, however, appear to have been reluctantly abandoned because
of repeated instructions from General Halleck, and the
movement toward Shreveport in the spring and early summer
of 1864 was begun. From the protracted and envenomed
controversy to which it gave rise among the officers on
both sides its disastrous ending is familiar to all.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c010'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>While this joint land and naval expedition was yet in
contemplation Mr. Lincoln found time to inform the Federal
commander of his opinions respecting the establishment of a
civil government in Louisiana. In his letter of August 5,
1863, to General Banks he wrote:</p>

<p class='c013'>While I very well know what I would be glad for Louisiana to do,
it is quite a different thing for me to assume direction of the matter. I
would be glad for her to make a new constitution recognizing the
emancipation proclamation, and adopting emancipation in those parts of
the State to which the proclamation does not apply. And while she is
at it, I think it would not be objectionable for her to adopt some practical
system by which the two races could gradually live themselves out
of the old relation to each other, and both come out better prepared for
the new. Education for young blacks should be included in the plan.
After all, the power or element of “contract” may be sufficient for this
probationary period; and, by its simplicity and flexibility, may be the
better.</p>

<p class='c013'>As an anti-slavery man, I have a motive to desire emancipation which
pro-slavery men do not have; but even they have strong enough reason
to thus place themselves again under the shield of the Union; and to
thus perpetually hedge against the recurrence of the scenes through which
we are now passing.</p>

<p class='c000'>He expressed his approval of the registry which he supposed
Mr. Durant was making with a view to an election
for a constitutional convention, the work of which, he hoped,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>would reach Washington by the meeting of Congress in
December. Before concluding this letter he added: “For
my own part, I think I shall not, in any event, retract the
emancipation proclamation; nor, as executive, ever return
to slavery any person who is freed by the terms of that proclamation,
or by any of the acts of Congress.”<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c010'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>He again invites attention to the fact that if Louisiana
should send members to Congress their admission would
depend upon the respective Houses and not to any extent upon
the wishes of the Executive.</p>

<p class='c000'>Copies of this communication he intended to send to Hahn,
Flanders and Durant. Three months later, when the gentleman
last named informed him that nothing had yet been
done toward the enrollment, Mr. Lincoln wrote immediately
to General Banks a letter which at once reveals both the
extent of his interest in this subject and his extreme disappointment
on learning that his wishes had been but little
regarded. Flanders, then in Washington, confirmed the account
of Durant. “This disappoints me bitterly,” said the
letter of November 5, 1863, and though the President did
not blame either General Banks or the Louisiana leaders for
this apparent neglect he urged them “to lose no more time.”
“I wish him [General Shepley], ...” continued the
letter, “without waiting for more territory, to go to work
and give me a tangible nucleus which the remainder of the
State may rally around as fast as it can, and which I can
at once recognize and sustain as the true State government.
And in that work I wish you and all under your command
to give them a hearty sympathy and support.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The instruction to Governor Shepley bases the movement
(and rightfully, too) upon the loyal element. Time is
important. There is danger, even now, that the adverse
element seeks insidiously to preoccupy the ground. If a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>professedly loyal men shall draw the disloyal about them, and
colorably set up a State government, repudiating the Emancipation
Proclamation and reëstablishing slavery, I cannot
recognize or sustain their work. I should fall powerless in
the attempt. This Government in such an attitude would be
a house divided against itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have said, and say again, that if a new State government,
acting in harmony with this government, and consistently
with general freedom, shall think best to adopt a
reasonable temporary arrangement in relation to the landless
and homeless freed people, I do not object; but my word is
out to be for and not against them on any question of their
permanent freedom. I do not insist upon such temporary arrangement,
but only say such would not be objectionable to
me.”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c010'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It should be remembered that Thomas J. Durant, who
was authorized to make the enrollment as well as to appoint
“registers” to assist him, was spokesman of the wealthy and
influential class of planters, or the conservative element whose
interests opposed any disturbance of existing conditions. He
appears to have drawn for the President a somewhat gloomy
picture of the political situation in Louisiana, and finally to
have protested against the government organized by the adverse
party. The outlook there, however, was not so discouraging
as represented; for as early as October 9 Governor
Shepley had renewed his order for the registration,
modifying the former one so far as to include “all loyal
citizens.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Interest was somewhat quickened by the announcement of
certain conservative leaders of an intention to hold a voluntary
election in conformity with the old constitution and laws
of the State. On October 27, 1863, an address signed by the
president and vice-president of the Central Executive Committee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>was published in the papers of New Orleans. This
appeal, directed to the loyal citizens of Louisiana, begins:</p>

<p class='c013'>The want of civil government in our State can, by a proper effort on
your part, soon be supplied, under laws and a constitution formed and
adopted by yourselves in a time of profound peace. It is made your duty,
as well as your right, to meet at the usual places, and cast your votes for
State and parish officers, members of Congress, and of the State Legislature.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>The day, as fixed by our laws, is Monday, the 2d day of November
next, 1863. There is nothing [proceeds the address] to prevent your
meeting on the day fixed by law, and selecting your agents to carry on
the affairs of government in our own State. The military will not interfere
with you in the exercise of your civil rights and duties, and we
think we can assure you that your action in this respect will meet the
approval of the National Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>The failure of those citizens addressed to exercise their
rights, it was asserted, would subject “the country” to the
danger of being thrown as “vacated” territory into the
hands of Congress.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c010'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Free State Committee having been invited to coöperate,
a correspondence ensued between the rival organizations;
but, on the ground that this movement was both illegal and
unjust, the Free State men declined to participate in the election.
In their reply the latter assert that “There is no law
in existence, as stated by you [The Executive Central Committee],
directing elections to be held on the first Monday
of November.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The constitution of 1852, as amended by the convention
of 1861, was overthrown and destroyed by the rebellion of the
people of Louisiana, and the subsequent conquest by the
arms of the United States does not restore your political
institutions.”<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c010'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The reply then proceeds to discuss the injustice of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>movement, and upon this subject its reasoning is entitled to
more respect. As to the status of the constitution of 1852, it
is not easy to comprehend how the secession convention, a
body universally regarded as revolutionary, could amend, in
the manner attempted, the fundamental law, seeing that this
revolution was not yet crowned with success.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though no general election was held in response to this
address, voting took place in two parishes, and certain persons
were chosen as Representatives in Congress. Before giving
an account of this election of November 2, 1863, it may be
proper to notice a petition submitted by the free colored people
of New Orleans to Governor Shepley praying to be registered
as voters so that they could “assist in establishing in the new
Convention a Civil Government” for their “beloved State
of Louisiana.” This address, prepared at a meeting on November
5, and not without ability, recites in appropriate language
the services rendered by free colored men to both the
Nation and the State. It is sufficient to observe here that
their prayer was not granted. The paper itself will be considered
in discussing the successive steps which led to the
complete enfranchisement of the race.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c010'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The preceding chapter has noticed President Lincoln’s
Amnesty Proclamation of December 8 as well as that part of
the accompanying message to Congress discussing his plan
for restoring Union governments in the insurgent States.
The House had not completed its organization for the
Thirty-eighth Congress when Thaddeus Stevens, a Representative
from Pennsylvania, either from curiosity or an anxiety
to oppose, as he conceived, the policy of the President, inquired
what names had been omitted in the call of members.
At a later stage of its first meeting, December 7, 1863, he
again referred to this subject by asking to have read the credentials
of persons claiming to be Representatives “from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>so-called State of Louisiana.” The acting clerk facetiously
promised compliance, and read a certificate signed by Mr.
John Leonard Riddell naming A. P. Field, Thomas Cottman
and Joshua Baker as persons elected to represent respectively
the First, Second and Fifth Congressional Districts of the
State.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c010'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On a resolution “That A. P. Field is not entitled to a seat
in this House from the State of Louisiana,” reported January
29, 1864, from the Committee of Elections, his right to admission
was fully discussed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under the apportionment of 1850 that State sent four, and
by the census of 1860 became entitled to five, Representatives.
By an act of Congress approved July 14, 1862, each State
entitled to more than one member in the lower House was to
be divided into as many districts as it had been allotted
Representatives.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, said Chairman Dawes, as Louisiana had never been
so divided no person in that State had been chosen according
to Federal law. The election under which Mr. Field claimed
a seat occurred in the old First Congressional District, which,
with a great portion of the city of New Orleans, included two
adjacent parishes, Placquemines and St. Bernard. On November
1, General Shepley issued a military order forbidding
the election, and none was held in New Orleans. In the two
outlying parishes, however, under the auspices of a citizens’
committee, to which returns were made, a few voters appeared
at the polls. In the parish of St. Bernard, the only
locality in which the House had any proof that electors participated,
Mr. Field received one hundred and fifty-six votes,
and though no evidence in support of his statement had been
offered, about the same number, he alleged, had been cast
for him in Placquemines.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question was, proceeded Mr. Dawes, whether a gentleman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>with this constituency could be in any sense considered
as having been elected. There were in his district over 10,000
qualified voters, and of these the claimant received the
support of only one hundred and fifty-six; hence nearly ten
thousand electors expressed no opinion, armed interference
having prevented 9,844 of them from indicating a preference.
There was no evidence that this majority acquiesced in what
was done by one hundred and fifty-six men in a corner of St.
Bernard parish where an election was permitted. If no other
objection existed, the State had not been districted as required
by the Act of July, 1862; this consideration of itself
appeared to the Committee a reason sufficient for his exclusion.
Further, his certificate was signed by one John Leonard
Riddell, himself chosen Governor at the same time and in
the same parishes. His term, according to the laws of Louisiana,
did not commence till January 1, 1864, and it was not
easy to comprehend how he came to regard himself as Executive
of the State on November 20, 1863, when he signed the
certificate presented by the claimant. Mr. Riddell, indeed,
had not then been inaugurated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Had not Congress failed to divide the State, the suppression
of this election would have been without justification
and have deserved the condemnation of the House. It, however,
did not conform to the laws of Louisiana, for the votes
were not cast nor were they counted or canvassed as prescribed
thereby. This, in substance, was the argument of Mr.
Dawes.</p>

<p class='c000'>By other members attention was invited to the fact that
under the same laws and conditions an election had been
held in Louisiana a year before, and in consequence two
Representatives admitted. To this observation Mr. Stevens
replied that Hahn and Flanders, the members referred to,
had been seated by the power of the House without, as he
then supposed, any law or right. Henry Winter Davis alone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>among all who spoke on the question approved the action
of the Military Governor on the ground that there was no
legal right to hold an election, and the attempt of any number
of persons to do so was an usurpation of sovereign authority
which was properly prevented. Other Representatives, however,
strongly condemned this act of Governor Shepley and
at least one desired the House to express as an amendment
to the resolution its disapproval of his conduct. Though not
the question in debate, there could be no mistaking upon
this point the sentiments of a majority of the members.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Field, permitted to address the House, observed that
it was the fault of the General Government that Union men
in Louisiana had not been aided by the previous administration.
If they had been, the blood of Illinois and Massachusetts
patriots would not have sprinkled the soil of his State.</p>

<p class='c000'>To show that some sort of government existed there he
caused the clerk to read a list of one hundred and twenty-five
officers acting in those parishes included within Federal
military lines, and added that though New Orleans since its
capture paid annually in taxes, collected through Governor
Shepley, two and a half million dollars, besides a considerable
sum in internal revenue, her people were represented neither
in the local nor the national Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>The constitution of Louisiana, he said, required that qualified
electors should be white males who had attained the age
of twenty-one years, and been residents of the State for
twelve months immediately preceding the election. The provision
was so modified by Governor Shepley that persons of
this description were allowed to vote after a residence of six
months. Mr. Field did not know whence was derived the
authority to amend constitutions.</p>

<p class='c000'>To secure his coöperation in establishing a loyal government
Union men met as early as September 19 in convention
at New Orleans, and appointed a committee of nine to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>present an address to the Military Governor inviting his
assistance. He declined, however, after a lengthy interview
to order an election for Representatives until the State had
first been divided. In fact, until instructions which he had
requested, were received from Washington he refused to order
any election whatever, though he volunteered to forward to
Mr. Lincoln any communication which they desired to address
him on that subject. Besides its correspondence with Governor
Shepley, the New Orleans convention on September 21
had sent a letter to General Banks, the Department commander,
to secure if possible his approval of their movement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notice, dated October 20, was given that an election would
be held, November 2, at the usual places in the parish of St.
Bernard, and the State and Federal offices to be filled, as
well as the precise places at which voters could cast their
ballots, were mentioned. Since the military authorities had
refused to assist them, and had then issued no order against
an election, loyal men thought it not improper to express
their opinions at the polls. As the Free State people considered
Louisiana out of the Union they declined to participate,
and though General Banks in obedience to instructions
from the President had subsequently ordered an election they
maintained the same attitude. The claimant’s party did not
oppose this order; for if unable to restore their State in the
manner most acceptable they were willing to coöperate in any
method likely to accomplish that object.</p>

<p class='c000'>Precisely what number of voters would be called a constituency
Mr. Field had not been informed. In the portion of
his Congressional District included in St. Bernard and
Placquemines parishes there were only 2,400 electors, and the
President’s plan required only one tenth of the number of
votes cast in 1860. Though the election of November 2 preceded
the Executive proclamation, that fact should not make
it void. The electors in New Orleans were not free to express
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>a choice, and even if it had been otherwise the vote in
the First District must have been greatly diminished since
1860, for he was assured by two paymasters that 7,000 men
had been recruited there for the Union army.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some members admitted that the national Government had
not given sufficient protection to Union men in Louisiana, and
therefore should not now take advantage of that neglect to
also deprive them of representation in Congress. These believed
that if Mr. Field had received a majority of the votes
in his district any informality in the election should be overlooked,
for the right to representation in Congress grows
out of the Constitution, and regulations governing such
elections are matters of mere convenience. The fact that no
State organization existed there did not create a legal impediment,
and it was no objection that Louisiana had not been redistricted,
for the additional member was not imposed as a
burden but as a right which she was free to exercise or not;
besides, the greater representation includes the less.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding these considerations, and strong, though
not universal, testimony to the claimant’s loyalty, he was
denied admission, February 9, 1864, by a vote of 85 to 48.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c010'><sup>[85]</sup></a>
His case, however, was not exactly similar to that of Messrs.
Hahn and Flanders, as stated by one Representative, for they
had received, in the circumstances, a comparatively large
vote.</p>

<p class='c000'>To this end came the movement of the planters designed
primarily to counteract that inaugurated by the Free State
Committee, which also, as we shall see, was soon at variance
with the military authorities. Important changes had occurred
in the shifting politics of his State before the House
had taken final action in the case of Mr. Field; these will
be briefly related.</p>

<p class='c000'>Military necessity had led the President to issue, December
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>8, 1863, his Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction
proposing, though not rigidly insisting upon, a plan for reinaugurating
State governments wherever there existed such a
loyal nucleus as could effectively assist in overthrowing the
rebellion. In discussing the affairs of Tennessee that plan
has been quoted at such length as to require no further mention
in this place.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c010'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>General Banks on January 8, 1864, announced his intention
of ordering an election of State officers. He was urged at
this point by the Free State Committee to allow their election
to go on, but he refused to yield even under pressure of an
immense public meeting favorable to their object.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c010'><sup>[87]</sup></a> Without
his coöperation their plan was doomed to failure, and when
entreaties did not avail to move him they promptly inveighed
against his methods and his motives in the columns of <cite>The
National Intelligencer</cite> at Washington. In a letter dated New
Orleans, January 9, 1864, a correspondent writes:</p>

<p class='c013'>President Lincoln has started a Missouri case in Louisiana, and has
made Banks our master; and Banks is another Schofield, only worse
than he. Our mass meeting last evening was a complete success; but
its object will be defeated by Banks, who, under orders direct from the
President, declares his purpose to order an election for a convention;
thus playing into the hands of Cottman, Riddle, and Fields, and their
crew. The Union men—the true Union men—are thunderstruck by the
course of the President in this matter.</p>

<p class='c013'>We were not informed of the President’s orders to General Banks
until the hour of the meeting last night, and the meeting was not informed
at all. General Shepley, who is generally liked, and who has
done all he could to promote the free State cause, and to organize a free
State government, will resign, and the election ordered by Banks will be
purely at military dictation, and will be so regarded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The correspondent does not know the secret springs of all
these acts of the President, but thinks he has probably been
deceived by base and interested men. “Banks,” he believes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“has the unchanged confidence of Mr. Lincoln.” The writer
concludes by asking whether it is not possible to get the President
to countermand his orders to Banks immediately, “and
let the people manage matters as they have begun to do?”<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c010'><sup>[88]</sup></a>
To prove that no line of policy would be acceptable to the
Free State Committee Mr. Field, in his remarks before the
House, read in full the communication from which these
excerpts are taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>To comprehend clearly the nature of the controversy which
so suddenly arose between the Free State General Committee
and the Federal commander in Louisiana it may be necessary
to explain with some detail the precise attitude of that
organization relative to the question at issue between the
adverse parties. In discussing the respective merits of the
State constitutions of 1852 and 1861 the organ of the Free
State men says:</p>

<p class='c013'>The question is altogether immaterial; for, in the conflict of arms
incident to this rebellion, the predominant ideas of the good people of
Louisiana have far preceded either constitution; and to reorganize now
the State on the slave basis, which both constitutions and the laws passed
under them recognized, has become an utter impossibility. Free soil and
free speech have grown up into absolute necessities, directly resulting
from the war, which has converted into dust and ashes all the constitutions
which Louisiana has ever made, embodying the ideas of property
in our fellow-man, and all the baneful results of this system of African
slavery. The present war is nothing but the conflict of the ideas of
slavery and liberty.... We cannot have peace until public opinion
is brought quite up to this point. We cannot reorganize the civil government
of our city, and still less that of our State, and get rid of the fearful
incubus of martial law now pressing down our energies by its arbitrary
influence, unless we believe, give utterance to and establish the fundamental
principle of our national government: “all men are created
free and equal.” We know of no better way to effect this than by calling
a convention as soon as possible, to declare the simple fact that Louisiana
now is and will forever be a free State.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c010'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>The party favoring this method insisted that in August,
1863, when General Shepley was in Washington, their plan
in all its parts was adopted in a Cabinet meeting, and that a
special order issued from the War Department directing the
Military Governor to carry it into execution. The movement
for reorganizing the State would thus be placed under control
of the steadfast opponents of slavery. They further claimed
that Mr. Lincoln then preferred the calling of a convention
to an election of State officers under the old constitution.
His letter of August 5, 1863, to General Banks certainly
leaves no doubt as to his sentiments at that time, for he
expressed his approval of the enrollment being taken by Durant
with a view to an election for a constitutional convention,
the mature work of which, he thought, should reach Washington
by the meeting of Congress. The impossibility of so
expediting registration outside of New Orleans as to be ready
for an election at that early date was explained to the President
by the Free State Committee.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. B. F. Flanders returning from Washington in October,
1863, reported the President as saying, in reply to an objection
that enough territory and population were not under protection
of the Union army to justify an election, that so
great was the necessity for immediate action that he would
recognize and sustain a State government organized by any
part of the population of which the National forces then
had control, and that he wished Flanders on his return to
Louisiana to say so.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c010'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The registration under Governor Shepley, though frequently
interrupted, had proceeded, and the Free State Committee,
to insure the success of their object, conferred with
him for the purpose of holding, about January 25, 1864, an
election for delegates to a State convention which, as already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>observed, intended to frame a new constitution abolishing
slavery everywhere throughout the State. The announcement,
then, on January 8, 1864, by General Banks of his intention
to order an election of State officers under the old
constitution was regarded by them as a decision for their
adversaries. Their objections to the proclamation itself will
be noticed in the proper place. It provided not only for an
election of State officers on February 22 following, but also
for the choice of delegates to a convention to be held in
April for a revision of the constitution. The paramount
objection of the Free State men was that the election of
State officers would, under the course of General Banks,
precede that for delegates to the convention, the point at
which they desired to begin the work of reëstablishing a civil
government for the State.</p>

<p class='c000'>To Thomas Cottman, who accompanied Mr. Field to
Washington claiming a seat in Congress as Representative
from the Second Louisiana District, Mr. Lincoln, on December
15, wrote:</p>

<p class='c013'>You were so kind as to say this morning that you desire to return to
Louisiana, and to be guided by my wishes, to some extent, in the part
you may take in bringing that State to resume her rightful relation to
the General Government.</p>

<p class='c013'>My wishes are in a general way expressed, as well as I can express
them, in the proclamation issued on the eighth of the present month, and
in that part of the annual message which relates to that proclamation.
It there appears that I deem the sustaining of the Emancipation Proclamation,
where it applies, as indispensable; and I add here that I would
esteem it fortunate if the people of Louisiana should themselves place
the remainder of the State upon the same footing.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c010'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Though this letter expressed as one of Mr. Lincoln’s
strongest wishes a hope that all Union men in Louisiana
would “eschew cliquism,” he was destined to be disappointed,
for at this very time letters from General Banks, dated December
6 and 16, informed him that Governor Shepley, Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Durant and others had given him to understand that they
were charged exclusively with the work of reconstruction in
Louisiana and hence he had not felt authorized to interfere.
Other officers had set up claims to jurisdiction conflicting
and interfering with his own powers of military administration.
Annoyed that a misunderstanding was delaying work
which he had been urging for a year, the President, on the
24th of December, wrote General Banks as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>I have all the while intended you to be master, as well in regard to
reorganizing a State government for Louisiana, as in regard to the military
matters of the department; and hence my letters on reconstruction
have nearly, if not quite, all been addressed to you. My error has
been that it did not occur to me that Governor Shepley or any one else
would set up a claim to act independently of you; and hence I said nothing
expressly upon the point.</p>

<p class='c013'>Language has not been guarded at a point where no danger was
thought of. I now tell you that in every dispute with whomsoever, you
are master.</p>

<p class='c013'>Governor Shepley was appointed to assist the commander of the department,
and not to thwart him or act independently of him. Instructions
have been given directly to him, merely to spare you detail labor,
and not to supersede your authority. This, in its liability to be misconstrued,
it now seems was an error in us. But it is past. I now distinctly
tell you that you are master of all, and that I wish you to take the case
as you find it, and give us a free State reorganization of Louisiana in the
shortest possible time. What I say here is to have a reasonable construction.
I do not mean that you are to withdraw from Texas, or
abandon any other military measure which you may deem important.
Nor do I mean that you are to throw away available work already done
for reconstruction; nor that war is to be made upon Governor Shepley, or
upon any one else, unless it be found that they will not coöperate with
you, in which case, and in all cases, you are master while you remain in
command of the department.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c010'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This letter making General Banks “master” of the situation
in Louisiana the President concluded by thanking him
for his successful and valuable operations in Texas. But
before receiving this extensive authority and the undoubted
assurance of Mr. Lincoln’s confidence the commander, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>December 30, submitted to the President a plan of reconstruction
based upon the Proclamation and the Message of the
8th of that month. For evident reasons this communication
deserves to be reproduced almost entire:</p>

<p class='c013'>I would suggest [says General Banks], as the only speedy and certain
method of accomplishing your object, that an election be ordered, of a
State government, under the constitution and laws of Louisiana, except
so much thereof as recognizes and relates to slavery, which should be
declared by the authority calling the election, and in the order authorizing
it, inoperative and void. The registration of voters to be made in
conformity with your Proclamation, and all measures hitherto taken with
reference to State organization, not inconsistent with the Proclamation,
may be made available. A convention of the people for the revision of
the constitution may be ordered as soon as the government is organized,
and the election of members might take place on the same or a subsequent
day with the general election. The people of Louisiana will accept
such a proposition with favor. They will prefer it to any arrangement
which leaves the subject to them for an affirmative or negative
vote. Strange as this may appear, it is the fact. Of course a government
organized upon the basis of immediate and universal freedom, with the
general consent of the people, followed by the adaptation of commercial
and industrial interests to this order of things, and supported by the army
and navy, the influence of the civil officers of the Government, and the
Administration at Washington, could not fail by any possible chance to
obtain an absolute and permanent recognition of the principle of freedom
upon which it would be based. Any other result would be impossible.
The same influence would secure with the same certainty the selection
of proper men in the election of officers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let me assure you that this course will be far more acceptable to the
citizens of Louisiana than the submission of the question of slavery to
the chances of an election. Their self-respect, their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour propre</span></i> will
be appeased if they are not required to vote for or against it. Offer
them a government without slavery and they will gladly accept it as a
necessity resulting from the war. On all other points, sufficient guarantees
of right results can be secured; but the great question, that of immediate
emancipation, will be covered <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab initio</span></i>, by a conceded and absolute
prohibition of slavery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon this plan a government can be established whenever you wish—in
thirty or sixty days; a government that will be satisfactory to the
South and the North; to the South, because it relieves them from any
action in regard to an institution which cannot be restored, and which
they cannot condemn; and to the North, because it places the interests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>of liberty beyond all possible accident or chance of failure. The result
is certain.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c010'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Upon receiving this communication the President, who
cherished no plan of restoration to which exact conformity
was indispensable, expressed, January 13, 1864, in a letter to
General Banks his gratitude for the zeal and confidence manifested
by him on the question of reinaugurating a free State
government in Louisiana. He hoped, because of the authority
contained in the letter of December 24, that the Department
Commander had already commenced work. “Whether you
shall have done so or not,” continues the letter, “please, on
receiving this, proceed with all possible despatch, using your
own absolute discretion in all matters which may not carry
you away from the conditions stated in your letters to me,
nor from those of the message and proclamation of December
8. Frame orders, and fix times and places for this and
that, according to your own judgment.”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c010'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This letter repeats the idea of subordination to General
Banks of all officials in his department holding authority
from the President, and stated that the bearer of the communication,
Collector Dennison, of New Orleans, understood
the views of the commander and was willing to assist in
carrying them out. Before Mr. Dennison arrived in New
Orleans, however, General Banks had already, in his proclamation
of January 11, 1864, fixed a date for the election.
This action was determined, said the Department Commander,
upon ample assurance “that more than a tenth of the population
desire the earliest possible restoration of Louisiana to the
Union”; hence he invited “the loyal citizens of the State
qualified to vote in public affairs ... to assemble in
the election precincts designated by law, ... on the
22d of February, 1864, to cast their votes for the election of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>State officers herein named, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> Governor, Lieutenant-Governor,
Secretary of State, Treasurer, Attorney-General, Superintendent
of Public Instruction and Auditor of Public Accounts—who
shall, when elected, for the time being, and
until others are appointed by competent authority, constitute
the civil government of the State, under the constitution and
laws of Louisiana, except so much of said constitution and
laws as recognize, regulate or relate to slavery, which being
inconsistent with the present condition of public affairs, and
plainly inapplicable to any class of persons now existing
within its limits, must be suspended, and they are therefore
and hereby declared to be inoperative and void. This proceeding
is not intended to ignore the right of property existing
prior to the rebellion, nor to preclude the claim for compensation
of loyal citizens for losses sustained by enlistment
or other authorized acts of Government.”<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c010'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The qualifications of voters in this election were to be determined
by the oath of allegiance prescribed by the President’s
proclamation together with the condition annexed
to the elective franchise by the constitution of Louisiana.
Officers elected were to be duly installed on the 4th of
March.</p>

<p class='c000'>So much of the registration effected under direction of
Governor Shepley and the several Union Associations as
was not inconsistent with the proclamation and other orders
of the President was approved. The proclamation further
announced that arrangements would be made for the early
election of members of Congress for the State, and, that the
organic law might be made to conform to the will of the people
and harmonize with the spirit of the age, an election of delegates
to a convention for the revision of the constitution would
be held on the first Monday of April following.</p>

<p class='c000'>This proclamation declared, among other things, that</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>The fundamental law of the State is martial law.... The Government
is subject to the law of necessity, and must consult the condition
of things, rather than the preferences of men, and if so be that its
purposes are just and its measures wise, it has the right to demand that
questions of personal interest and opinion shall be subordinate to the
public good. When the national existence is at stake, and the liberties of
the people in peril, faction is treason.</p>

<p class='c013'>The methods herein proposed submit the whole question of government
directly to the people—first, by the election of executive officers, faithful
to the Union, to be followed by a loyal representation in both Houses of
Congress; and then by a convention which will confirm the action of the
people, and recognize the principles of freedom in the organic law. This
is the wish of the President.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c010'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On February 13, nine days before the election, General
Banks issued an order relative to the qualifications of electors.
It provided, in addition to the declarations on that subject in
his proclamation, that Union voters expelled from their homes
by the public enemy might cast their ballots for State officers
in the precincts where they temporarily resided and that qualified
electors enlisted in the army or navy could vote in those
precincts in which they might be found on election day. If
without the State, then commissioners would be appointed
to receive their ballots wherever stationed, returns to be
made to General Shepley.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c010'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>For governor three candidates were nominated—B. F.
Flanders, a representative of the Free State Committee;
Michael Hahn, the choice of those who approved the measures
of General Banks, and J. Q. A. Fellows, a pro-slavery
conservative who favored “the Constitution and the Union
with the preservation of the rights of all inviolate.” The
friends of Hahn would deny to persons of African descent
the privileges of citizenship, whereas the supporters of
Flanders generally would extend to them such rights and
immunities.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c010'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>On Washington’s birthday, as announced in the proclamation
of General Banks, an election was held in seventeen
parishes, Hahn receiving 6,183, Fellows 2,996 and Flanders
2,232 votes, a total of 11,411, of which 107 were cast by
Louisiana soldiers stationed at Pensacola, Florida.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c010'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Writing February 25 to the President General Banks says:</p>

<p class='c013'>The election of the 22d of February was conducted with great spirit
and propriety. No complaint is heard from any quarter, so far as I
know, of unfairness or undue influence on the part of the officers of the
Government. At some of the strictly military posts the entire vote of
the Louisiana men was for Mr. Flanders, at others for Mr. Hahn, according
to the inclination of the voters. Every voter accepted the oath
prescribed by your proclamation of the 8th of December.... The
ordinary vote of the State has been less than forty thousand. The proportion
given on the 22d of February is nearly equal to the territory
covered by our arms.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c010'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The friends of the Free State General Committee in a protest
pronounced the result of the election “the registration
of a military edict,” and “worthy of no respect from the
representatives and Executive of the nation.” To the question
whether this election had in the meaning of the President
reëstablished a State government they promptly answered
in the negative, for the commanding general recognized
the Louisiana constitution of 1852 and ordered an election
under it in which the votes of the people had nothing to
do with reëstablishing government; his proclamation, by
recognizing the existence of the old constitution, made the
reëstablishment beforehand for them. The Governor and
Lieutenant-Governor, together with the other executive officers
chosen, did not, they argued, constitute a State government;
for all the constitutions of Louisiana, including that
of 1852, described the government as consisting of three departments:
executive, legislative and judicial.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Though not avowed, the reason of Banks’ failure to order
an election for members of the Legislature was plain, for
there was not, they claimed, within the Union lines a sufficient
number of parishes to elect a majority of that body, and
less than a majority was, by the constitution, not a quorum
to do business; so that no officer elected could be legally
paid, for that could be done by only a legal appropriation. The
same constitution, they said further, provided that Justices
of the Supreme and District Courts, as well as justices of the
peace, should be elected by the people. The present incumbents
had been simply appointed by General Shepley. Should
Mr. Hahn under pretence of being civil governor undertake
to appoint judicial officers, the act would be a mere usurpation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not only, they declared, had no State government been
established by this election, but still further, the proclamation
of the President had not in the matter of electors been
complied with; for Article XII. of the constitution of 1852
says: “No soldier, seaman, or marine in the army or navy
of the United States ... shall be entitled to vote at
any election in this State.” Yet, continued the protestants,
it was a notorious fact that the general commanding permitted
soldiers recruited in Louisiana, and otherwise qualified,
to vote, and that many availed themselves of the privilege.
Again, they went on to say, the Legislature by act of March
20, 1856, provided for the appointment in New Orleans of
a register of voters whose office should be closed three days
before an election, and no one registered during that period.
Now prior to the late election, the register having closed his
office according to law, orders were at once given to two
other officers, recorders of the city, who had no such powers
or functions by law, to register voters, which they did night
and day, and persons so registered were allowed to vote.</p>

<p class='c000'>Referring to the declared intention of General Banks to
order an election of delegates to a constitutional convention,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>and by a subsequent order fix the basis of representation,
the number of delegates and the details of the election,
they said: “This will put the whole matter under military
control, and the experience of the last election shows that
only such a convention can be had as the overshadowing influence
of the military authority will permit. Under an election
thus ordered, and a constitution thus established, a republican
form of government cannot be formed. It is simply
a fraud to call it the reëstablishment of a State government.
In these circumstances, the only course left to the truly loyal
citizens of Louisiana is, to protest against the recognition
of this pretended Government, and to appeal to the calm
judgment of the nation to procure such action from Congress
as will forbid military commanders to usurp the powers
which belong to Congress alone, or to the loyal people of
Louisiana.”<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c010'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>But neither the protest nor the criticism of Free State
men availed to arrest the march of events, and in the presence
of a vast multitude Michael Hahn, who had received a majority
of all the votes cast, was inaugurated Governor amidst
great enthusiasm on March 4. To the oath prescribed in
the amnesty and reconstruction proclamation of December 8,
1863, given above, was added the following:</p>

<p class='c013'>And I do further solemnly swear, that I am qualified according to the
constitution of the State to hold the office to which I have been elected,
and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the
duties incumbent on me as Governor of the State of Louisiana, according
to the best of my abilities and understanding, agreeably to the Constitution
and Laws of the United States, and in support of and according
to the constitution and laws of this State, so far as they are consistent
with the necessary military occupation of the State by the troops of the
United States for the suppression of the rebellion, and the full restoration
of the authority of the United States.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c010'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>This language clearly indicates the legal theory upon which
General Banks was proceeding, and citizens understood that
Mr. Hahn represented a popular power entirely subordinate
to the armed occupation of the State.</p>

<p class='c000'>On March 13, 1864, the President wrote the following
private letter to Governor Hahn:</p>

<p class='c013'>I congratulate you on having fixed your name in history as the first
free-state governor of Louisiana. Now you are about to have a convention,
which, among other things, will probably define the elective franchise.
I barely suggest for your private consideration whether some of
the colored people may not be let in—as, for instance, the very intelligent,
and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks. They
would probably help, in some trying time to come, to keep the jewel of
liberty within the family of freedom. But this is only a suggestion, not
to the public, but to you alone.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c010'><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking of this personal note Mr. Blaine says: “It was
perhaps the earliest proposition from any authentic source
to endow the negro with the right of suffrage, and was an
indirect but most effective answer to those who subsequently
attempted to use Mr. Lincoln’s name in support of policies
which his intimate friends instinctively knew would be abhorrent
to his unerring sense of justice.”<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c010'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>At the suggestion of General Banks, the President two days
later invested Mr. Hahn until further order “with the powers
exercised hitherto by the military governor of Louisiana.”<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c010'><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>From the sentiments of the Free State party it requires
little insight into human affairs to foretell that in some
manner they would soon be found in opposition. Their candidate,
Mr. B. F. Flanders, who received fewer votes than
either of his competitors, was a prominent official in the
Treasury Department, and from this vantage ground, without,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>so far as appears, rebuke from Secretary Chase, began to
stir up in Congress a feeling of hostility to the new government
in Louisiana. Precisely why Mr. Lincoln decided to
take into his own hands the entire subject of reconstruction
may be collected without difficulty from what has already
been said; but that this determination was confirmed by his
knowledge of an alliance between the Free State leaders and
the “Radicals” in Congress there can be little doubt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Department Commander in a general order gave notice
on March 11 that an election would be held on the 28th
of that month for the choice of delegates to a State convention
to meet in New Orleans “for the revision and amendment of
the constitution of Louisiana.”<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c010'><sup>[106]</sup></a> Five days later, March 16,
Governor Hahn, in a proclamation to the sheriffs and other
officers concerned, authorized the election and commanded
them to give due notice thereof to the qualified voters of the
State and to make prompt returns to the Secretary of State in
New Orleans.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c010'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Pursuant to these notices the election was held on the 28th,
and resulted in the choice of ninety-seven members, two of
whom were rejected because of irregular returns. The entire
State was entitled to 150 delegates. The parish of Orleans
was represented by sixty-three members, leaving to the
country parishes but thirty-two. Of the vote, which was exceedingly
light, no return appears to have been published.
Because of their recent defeat no nominations were made by
the Radicals, and this fact, together with heavy rains on election
day, was assigned by Governor Hahn in a letter to the
President as an explanation of the meagre vote. The Parish
of Ascension, which in 1860 had a population of 3,940 whites,
elected her delegates by 61 votes; Placquemines, which by the
same census had 2,529 white inhabitants, cast 246, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>single delegate from Madison was chosen by only twenty-eight
electors.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c010'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>General Banks informed a committee of Congress that all
that section of the State as far up as Point Coupée voted; some
men from the Red River cast their ballots at Vidalia. In his
statement he declared that “The city of New Orleans is really
the State of Louisiana”; yet at that time it contained less
than half the population of the State.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c010'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The constitutional convention, which assembled April 6,
1864, was organized on the 7th with E. H. Durell as president,
and after a session of more than two and a half months
adjourned July 25. A proclamation of the Governor appointed
the 5th of September as the time for taking a vote on
the work of the convention. The result was 6,836 for the
adoption, and 1,556 for the rejection of the constitution.
Besides these there were a number of electors who did not
vote on either side of the question.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c010'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Of the work of the convention General Banks spoke as
follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>In a State which held 331,726 slaves, one half of its entire population
in 1860, more than three fourths of whom had been specially excepted
from the Proclamation of Emancipation, and were still held <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</span></i> in
bondage, the convention declared by a majority of all the votes to which
the State would have been entitled if every delegate had been present
from every district in the State:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Instantaneous, universal, uncompensated, unconditional emancipation
of slaves!</p>

<p class='c013'>It prohibited forever the recognition of property in man!</p>

<p class='c013'>It decreed the education of all the children, without distinction of race
or color!</p>

<p class='c013'>It directs all men, white or black, to be enrolled as soldiers for the
public defence!</p>

<p class='c013'>It makes all men equal before the law!</p>

<p class='c013'>It compels, by its regenerating spirit, the ultimate recognition of all
the rights which national authority can confer upon an oppressed race!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>It wisely recognizes for the first time in constitutional history, the interest
of daily labor as an element of power entitled to the protection of
the State.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c010'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>At the same election, that of September 5, the following
persons were chosen Representatives in Congress: M. F.
Bonzano, A. P. Field, W. D. Mann, T. M. Wells and R. W.
Taliaferro. A Legislature was elected at the same time, the
members of which were almost entirely in favor of a free
State, and by this body seven electors of President and Vice-President
were appointed. On October 10th two United
States Senators were elected—R. King Cutler for the unexpired
term ending March 4, 1867, and Charles Smith for the
vacancy created by the resignation of Judah P. Benjamin, and
ending March 4, 1865.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c010'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is matter of familiar history that the State government
thus organized was never recognized by Congress. The question
was presented to that body December 5, 1864, at the
opening of the second session of the Thirty-eighth Congress,
when the claimants above named appeared in Washington
applying for admission to seats, and again in January and
February, 1865, upon consideration of a joint resolution declaring
certain States not entitled to representation in the
Electoral College. As in the case of Tennessee, however, the
vote offered by Louisiana was not counted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The agency of the President in setting up this civil government,
and the successive steps in its accomplishment have been
related with some degree of minuteness, so that the nature of
the controversy between the Executive and the Legislative
branches of the Government may be better understood.
Whether Mr. Lincoln exceeded his constitutional authority
will be considered when an account has been presented of the
result of his efforts to restore civil government in the States
where Federal authority had been overthrown.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>III<br /> <span class='large'>ARKANSAS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The people of northern Arkansas were strongly attached
to the Union, and until December 20, 1860,
when a commissioner from Alabama addressed its
Legislature, no secession movement took place within the State.
Her geographical position classed her with the Western, her
productions bound up her interests with the Southern, States.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c010'><sup>[113]</sup></a>
As late as January 5, 1861, resolutions opposing separate action
were adopted almost unanimously by the largest meeting
ever held at Van Buren. Mr. Lincoln’s election was not then
deemed a sufficient cause to dissolve the Union. Citizens of
every party favored all honorable efforts for its preservation,
and demonstrations to the contrary were regarded as the work
of only an extreme and inconsiderable faction.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c010'><sup>[114]</sup></a> So rapid,
however, was the succession of events that scarcely two weeks
had elapsed when she exhibited signs of resting uneasily in
the Union; for on January 16 a bill submitting to popular
vote the question of holding a convention passed the Legislature.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c010'><sup>[115]</sup></a>
At the election of delegates to this assembly 23,626
votes were cast for the Union, against 17,927 for the secession,
candidates. Though this convention, which assembled March
4, was organized by the choice of Union officers, the proposal
to hold it had been carried by a majority of 11,586 in the election
of February 18. While secession was strongly urged, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>conditional ordinance was defeated by a vote of 39 to 35.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c010'><sup>[116]</sup></a>
At Van Buren and Fort Smith salutes of thirty-nine guns
were fired in honor of the loyal members. The inaugural of
President Lincoln, received two days after organizing, produced
a somewhat unfavorable impression. On the 17th an
ordinance, reported by a self-constituted committee of seven
secessionists and seven coöperationists, was unanimously
adopted.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c010'><sup>[117]</sup></a> This provided for an election on the first Monday
of August, when the qualified voters in the State could cast
their ballots either for “secession” or “coöperation.” The
result, though not wholly satisfactory to either party, afforded
time for deliberation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tidings of the fall of Sumter, together with the President’s
proclamation and a requisition for troops from the Secretary
of War, interrupted the brief interval of repose following the
adjournment of the convention. In these circumstances the
State was compelled to make a choice of sides. Governor
Rector’s reply, April 22, to this requisition shows him to have
been ardently in favor of disunion; the president of the convention,
concurring in this sentiment, issued a call for that
body to reassemble May 6, when an ordinance of secession
was promptly passed with but one dissenting vote.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c010'><sup>[118]</sup></a> By a
resolution the convention authorized the Governor to call out,
if necessary, 60,000 men, and ordered the issue of $2,000,000
in bonds. Another ordinance confiscated debts due to persons
in non-slaveholding States.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c010'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The first military movement, after the ordinance of secession
had been carried, aimed to secure Federal property within
the State, and their value to the South singled out for seizure
the arsenals at Fort Smith and Little Rock. The latter city
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>on February 5 was thrown into a great turmoil of confusion
and excitement by the unexpected arrival of a body of troops
from Helena with the avowed purpose of taking the arsenal;
more soldiers arrived during that and the succeeding day until
about 400 had assembled. Though the Governor, in response
to their inquiry, informed the city council that this force was
not there by his order, the troops believed they were acting
under his command; at any rate they came to take the arsenal
and were not to be diverted from their object. To prevent a
collision, which must have followed a refusal of the commanding
officer to surrender to a body of men disavowed by their
Governor, the latter was easily persuaded to assume the responsibility
of the movement and he consented to demand its
surrender in the name of the State. This demand Captain
Totten asked until three o’clock the next day to consider; then
he made known his readiness to evacuate the arsenal, which
about noon of the following day was delivered to the State
authorities.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c010'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The delegates of Arkansas on May 18 took their seats in
the Confederate Congress.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c010'><sup>[121]</sup></a> The convention, it will be observed,
assumed at the outset the functions of a law-making
body, and, because of further extending its authority by the
appointment of a Military Board, soon came into conflict with
both the Governor and the Legislature. When the convention
empowered the former to call out, if necessary, 60,000
men it divided the State into two districts, an eastern and a
western. General Bradley was elected to the command of the
former and General Pearce, late of the United States Army,
to that of the latter division. Before General McCulloch,
stationed in the Indian Territory, could assume any offensive
operations the Federal General, Lyon, in pursuit of Jackson,
approached the southern boundary of Missouri; upon this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the Military Board called out ten regiments for defence. On
June 21 it despatched to Richmond a messenger who proposed
to transfer to the Confederate Government all the State
troops with their arms making, however, a condition precedent:
they were to be employed for the protection of Arkansas;
but as the Secretary of State could make no promise as
to their future disposition the transfer was not then effected.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c010'><sup>[122]</sup></a>
On July 4 a second effort was made by a member of the Military
Board who visited General Hardee, with whom an arrangement
was completed by which a vote should be taken
among the troops. If a majority of each company consented,
those so consenting were to be turned over as a company. If
a majority declined, the company was to be disbanded altogether.
One entire company was thus mustered out, and
from various motives two or three hundred soldiers returned
home. This was from the eastern division. The western
was not so easily disposed of. The Military Board after the
battle of Springfield directed General Pearce to turn over his
force to Hardee, who became angry when the agent proposed
to submit the question of transfer, and refused to allow it to
be done; this insubordinate conduct he followed up by writing
an abusive letter to the Board. Pearce then separated his
troops from McCulloch’s command and marched them back
to Arkansas, where they were informally disbanded and sent
home. Fearing such a result, the Board had ordered General
Pearce to do nothing further in the matter, but their despatches
arrived too late.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c010'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Governor Rector’s account shows Arkansas troops, claimed
to be 22,000 in number, to have been at that time in a state of
complete demoralization.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c010'><sup>[124]</sup></a> The Germans and the Irish, as
well as their descendants, showing little inclination to enlist,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>the Governor ascribed their indifference to a want of opportunity
for promotion in the service. If this was not the cause,
then, he thought, authority should be given to draft a regiment
of each race.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c010'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>More than a third of the voting population was in the field,
and as late as October they had received no pay except Arkansas
war bonds, the worthlessness of which occasioned
much murmuring. This discontent was heightened somewhat
by the poor equipment of the regiments, many soldiers
being without blankets or shoes.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c010'><sup>[126]</sup></a> There were other symptoms
of unrest within the State. On the charge of attempted
insurrection two negro men and a girl were hanged in Monroe
County.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this occasioned much uneasiness, but the chief cause of
alarm was the Union sentiment known to exist in the State.
In October twenty-seven persons were brought to Little Rock
as members of a secret Union organization in Van Buren
County and placed in jail to await a civil trial. Many others
also were taken about this time, and it was estimated that the
“Peace and Constitutional Society” numbered 1,700 members
in Arkansas.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c010'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The activity of Federal armies in the West excited so much
apprehension that Governor Rector on the 18th of February,
by proclamation, called into immediate service every man in
the State subject to military duty.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c010'><sup>[128]</sup></a> A Confederate force
under Price was driven into Arkansas by General Curtis on
the same day, and within a week the commandant at Pocahontas
issued an appeal to every man “to turn out promptly,
shoulder his musket, and drive the vandals from the State.”
The Richmond Government being unable to assist Arkansas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>she was forced to rely upon her own resources and such aid
as might be obtained from Missouri, the Indian Territory and
Texas.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c010'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Disaster and a conviction of neglect led the Governor in
May, in an address to the people, to express his indignation
and threaten to secede from secession. He said:</p>

<p class='c013'>If the arteries of the Confederate heart do not permeate beyond the
east bank of the Mississippi, let southern Missourians, Arkansians,
Texans and the great West know it and prepare for the future. Arkansas
lost, abandoned, subjugated is not Arkansas as she entered the Confederate
Government. Nor will she remain Arkansas, a Confederate
State, desolated as a wilderness. Her children, fleeing from the wrath
to come, will build them a new ark, and launch it on new waters, seeking
a haven somewhere of equality, safety and rest.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c010'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>After the battle of Pea Ridge General Curtis moved to
White River, and on May 1 occupied Batesville, where he
witnessed many demonstrations of attachment to the Union.
Judges of courts, clergymen and other leading citizens came
forward and voluntarily took the oath of allegiance to the
United States. A threatened advance of the Union forces
upon Little Rock created the greatest excitement there, and the
Governor by proclamation ordered the militia to repair immediately
to its defence; but not finding himself sufficiently supported
he fled.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c010'><sup>[131]</sup></a> The concentration at Corinth of all available
Confederate strength was the cause of the weakness of Arkansas
at this time. Ten regiments had also been withdrawn from
the army of General Curtis to reënforce the Federal troops in
Mississippi. This left him in no condition to march upon the
State capital, and for the time it was saved. Twelve thousand
poorly equipped men had assembled there in response to the
appeal of Governor Rector.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the occupation of Helena by Federal troops Mr. Lincoln
appointed John S. Phelps, of Missouri, military governor.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c010'><sup>[132]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>On August 19, 1862, he left St. Louis for Helena; but
as the contemplated movement was not then made his office
was of little importance. From the Union refugees at that
point two regiments of Arkansas men were organized. The
fall of Vicksburg in July, 1863, however, enabled the Union
army to assume offensive operations, and the summer had not
greatly advanced before a strong column was moving on
Little Rock, the capture of which, September 10, 1863, was a
fatal blow to Confederate authority throughout the State.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amidst all its distresses the northern section of Arkansas
had maintained its loyalty. Recent reverses to Confederate
arms encouraged desertion from their ranks, Union sympathizers
became active, and movements begun by them were
joined by numbers who now regarded the Confederate cause
as lost. Many, however, fearing a restoration of that authority,
hesitated to identify themselves with the more pronounced
loyalists. A newspaper favorable to the General
Government was established at the capital. Meetings were
held, and resolutions pledging unconditional support of the
Union cause adopted. Citizens, both white and black, were
organized, and by December, 1863, eight regiments of Arkansas
troops had enlisted in the Federal service.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c010'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A still more encouraging symptom was the return of eminent
persons who now came forward to advocate the Union
cause. Prominent among these was Brigadier-General E. W.
Gantt, of the Confederate army, recently a prisoner of war
and pardoned under the Amnesty Proclamation of the President.
Toward the close of 1863 he thus describes the feeling
of the people:</p>

<p class='c013'>The Union sentiment is manifesting itself on all sides and by every indication—in
Union meetings—in desertions from the Confederate army—in
taking the oath of allegiance unsolicited—in organizing for home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>defence, and enlisting in the Federal army. Old flags that have been hid
in the crevices of rocks, and been worshipped by our mountain people as
holy relics, are flung to the breeze, and followed to the Union army with
an enthusiasm that beggars all description. The little county of Perry,
that votes only about 600, and which has been turned wrong side out in
search of conscripts by Hindman and his fellow-murderers and oppressors,
with their retinue of salaried gentlemen and negro boys, sent down
a company of ninety-four men. Where they came from, and how they
kept their old flag during these three years of terror, persecution and
plunder, I can’t tell. But they were the proudest-looking set of men I
ever saw, and full of fight.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c010'><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The retreat of General Banks from the Red River country
changed greatly the aspect of Federal affairs in Arkansas,
for it allowed all the Confederate forces in the vicinity to
concentrate against the small army of General Steele, compelling
him to act on the defensive at Little Rock. The
State coming once more to a considerable extent under Confederate
control, loyalists became scarce and gradually lost
energy and hope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Local reverses, however, were not allowed to interrupt the
comprehensive policy of the President, and early in 1864 preparations
were made to reorganize the State government.
This movement, like those in Tennessee and Louisiana, was
based upon the Amnesty and Reconstruction Proclamation of
December 8, 1863. Even before this step had been taken
the President was already moulding the diverse elements into
a power that would ultimately undermine Confederate influence
in the State. In the preceding summer, July 31, 1863,
he had written General S. A. Hurlbut:</p>

<p class='c013'>I understand that Senator Sebastian, of Arkansas, thinks of offering to
resume his place in the Senate. Of course the Senate, and not I, would
decide whether to admit or reject him. Still I should feel great interest
in the question. It may be so presented as to be one of the very greatest
national importance; and it may be otherwise so presented as to be
of no more than temporary personal consequence to him.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>The emancipation proclamation applies to Arkansas.... I think
I shall not retract or repudiate it. Those who shall have tasted actual
freedom I believe can never be slaves or quasi-slaves again. For the
rest, I believe some plan substantially being gradual emancipation would
be better for both white and black. The Missouri plan, recently adopted,
I do not object to on account of the time for ending the institution; but
I am sorry the beginning should have been postponed for seven years,
leaving all that time to agitate for the repeal of the whole thing. It
should begin at once, giving at least the new-born a vested interest in
freedom which could not be taken away. If Senator Sebastian could
come with something of this sort from Arkansas, I, at least, should take
great interest in his case; and I believe a single individual will have
scarcely done the world so great a service. See him, if you can, and read
this to him; but charge him to not make it public for the present.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c010'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Union officers in the West were urged by Mr. Lincoln in
October, 1862, to assist and encourage repentant rebel communities
to elect both State officers and members of Congress.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c010'><sup>[136]</sup></a>
As this involved a recognition of existing governments
it need scarcely be observed that the march of events
forced the President later to occupy somewhat different
ground; nor is it more necessary to add, that to his main purpose,
to undermine secession and restore the Union, he adhered
inflexibly. With this fundamental object all his acts
harmonize.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the time of her secession, W. K. Sebastian represented
Arkansas in the United States Senate and abandoned his seat;
he was now ready to assist in restoring his State to her old
status. Of these evidences of disintegration in Confederate
interests within the State the President was very exactly informed,
and it was because of his conviction that many persons
hitherto supporting that cause were either wavering in
their allegiance or had become hostile to secession that he
wrote, January 5, 1864, to General Steele:</p>

<p class='c013'>I wish to afford the people of Arkansas an opportunity of taking the
oath prescribed in the proclamation of December 8, 1863, preparatory to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>reorganizing a State Government there. Accordingly I send you by General
Kimball some blank books and other blanks, the manner of using
which will, in the main, be suggested by an inspection of them; and General
Kimball will add some verbal explanations.</p>

<p class='c013'>Please make a trial of the matter immediately at such points as you may
think likely to give success. I suppose Helena and Little Rock are two
of them. Detail any officer you may see fit to take charge of the subject
at each point; and which officer, it may be assumed, will have authority
to administer the oath. These books, of course, are intended to be permanent
records. Report to me on the subject.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c010'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A week had scarcely elapsed when Mr. Lincoln approved
the suggestions of General Banks relative to reinaugurating a
civil government for Louisiana, and, doubtless, he knew no
reason why similar work might not be going on simultaneously
in Arkansas; therefore he repeated to General Steele
what in substance he had already communicated to the
Federal commander of the Department of the Gulf. His instructions,
dated January 20, 1864, and quoted below, are
self-explanatory, and in no important particular differ from
the Louisiana Plan:</p>

<p class='c013'>Sundry citizens of the State of Arkansas petition me that an election
may be held in that State, at which to elect a governor thereof; ...
that it be assumed at said election and thenceforward that the constitution
and laws of the State, as before the rebellion, are in full force, except
that the constitution is so modified as to declare that “there shall be
neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except in the punishment for
crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted; but the General
Assembly may make such provision for the free people as shall recognize
and declare their permanent freedom, provide for their education, and
which may yet be consistent, as a temporary arrangement, with their
present condition as a laboring, landless, and homeless class;” and also
except that all now existing laws in relation to slaves are inoperative and
void; that said election to be held on the twenty-eighth day of March next
at all the usual voting places of the State, or all such as voters may attend
for that purpose; that the voters attending at each place at 8 o’clock in the
morning of said day, may choose judges and clerks of election for that
place; that all persons qualified by said constitution and laws, and taking
the oath prescribed in the President’s proclamation of December the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>8th, 1863, either before or at the election, and none others, may be voters,
provided that persons having the qualifications aforesaid, and being in
the volunteer military service of the United States, may vote once wherever
they may be at voting places; that each set of judges and clerks may
make return directly to you on or before the eleventh day of April next;
that in all other respects said election may be conducted according to said
modified constitution and laws; that on receipt of said returns, you count
said votes, and that if the number shall reach or exceed five thousand four
hundred and six, you canvass said votes and ascertain who shall thereby
appear to have been elected governor; and that on the eighteenth day of
April next, the person so appearing to have been elected, and appearing before
you at Little Rock to have, by you, administered to him an oath to
support the Constitution of the United States and said modified constitution
of the State of Arkansas, and actually taking said oath, be, by you,
declared qualified, and be enjoined to immediately enter upon the duties
of the office of governor of said State; and that you thereupon declare
the constitution of the State of Arkansas to have been modified and
amended as aforesaid by the action of the people as aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c013'>You will please order an election immediately, and perform the other
parts assigned you, with necessary incidentals, all according to the foregoing.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c010'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>By discussion and organization the elements opposed to
the Richmond Government aroused so much enthusiasm that
Unionists anticipated the wishes of the President by meeting,
January 8, 1864, in convention at Little Rock. This assembly,
composed of forty-four delegates representing, as
they claimed, twenty-two of the fifty-four counties in the
State, was made up of members elected at various mass meetings
by very meagre votes. This at least was an objection
then urged by those who were adverse to the purposes of the
convention. They further stated that many of the counties
represented were without the Federal military lines. It was
admitted that if these counties lay beyond Union lines neither
were they occupied by Confederate forces, and that generally
the delegates were gentlemen of character and patriotism.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c010'><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>In a published address the convention stated frankly:</p>

<p class='c013'>We found after remaining at Little Rock about a week, under a temporary
organization, that delegates were present from twenty-two counties,
elected by the people, and that six other counties had held elections,
and that their representatives were looked for daily. We then organized
the Convention permanently, and determined that while we could not
properly claim to be the people of Arkansas in Convention assembled,
with full and final authority to adopt a constitution, yet, being the representatives,
by election, of a considerable portion of the State, and understanding,
as we believed, the sentiment of nearly all our citizens who desire
the immediate benefits of a government under the authority of the
United States, we also determined to present a constitution and plan of
organization, which, if adopted by them, becomes at once their act as
effectually as if every county in the State had been represented in the Convention.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c010'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>An amended constitution was adopted by this convention
on January 22. By it the act of secession was declared null
and void; slavery was abolished immediately and unconditionally,
and the Confederate debt wholly repudiated.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c010'><sup>[141]</sup></a> These
important changes in the fundamental law of the State indicate
the sentiments of the delegates. Isaac Murphy was appointed
Provisional Governor; C. C. Bliss, Lieutenant-Governor
and R. T. J. White, Secretary of State. These officers
were inaugurated on the same day that the convention adopted
the constitution; this by its schedule was to be submitted to
a popular vote at an election to be held March 14, when State
officers and Representatives in Congress would also be
chosen.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c010'><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Ignorant that the movement to restore a civil government
had proceeded so far, Mr. Lincoln had sent his instructions
to General Steele. As these had been carefully considered
it was feared the work of the convention would differ in some
essential particular from the plan outlined for the Federal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>commander. To prevent such a consequence the President
wrote General Steele again on January 27 as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>I have addressed a letter to you and put it in the hands of Mr. Gantt
and other Arkansas gentlemen, containing a program for an election in
that State. This letter will be handed you by some of these gentlemen.
Since writing it, I see that a Convention in Arkansas having the same general
object, has taken some action, which I am afraid may clash somewhat
with my program. I therefore can do no better than to ask you to see
Mr. Gantt immediately on his return, and with him do what you and he
may deem necessary to harmonize the two plans into one, and then put
it through with all possible vigor. Be sure to retain the free-State Constitutional
provision in some unquestionable form and you and he can fix
the rest. The points I have made in the program have been well considered.
Take hold with an honest heart and a strong hand. Do not let
any questionable man control or influence you.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c010'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The President’s interest in the proceedings of the convention
and his anxiety about the outcome of its deliberations
appear in a letter to General Steele written three days
after the above.<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c010'><sup>[144]</sup></a> So favorable were his impressions of the
progress reported that he believed the best his subordinate
could do “would be to help them on their own plan”; of
this, however, General Steele, who was on the ground, was to
be the judge. To Governor Murphy he telegraphed, February
6, that his order concerning an election was made in ignorance
of any action which the convention might take; also
that his subsequent communication to General Steele directed
that officer to assist, not to hinder, the delegates.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c010'><sup>[145]</sup></a> General
Thayer also was informed that the apparent conflict between
the President and the convention was altogether accidental.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c010'><sup>[146]</sup></a>
On February 17, Mr. Lincoln explained the situation more
fully to William M. Fishback:</p>

<p class='c013'>When I fixed a plan for an election in Arkansas I did it in ignorance
that your convention was doing the same work. Since I learned the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>latter fact I have been constantly trying to yield my plan to them. I have
sent two letters to General Steele, and three or four despatches to you
and others, saying that he, General Steele, must be master, but that it
will probably be best for him to merely help the convention on its own
plan. Some single mind must be master, else there will be no agreement
in anything, and General Steele, commanding the military and being on
the ground, is the best man to be that master. Even now citizens are
telegraphing me to postpone the election to a later day than either that
fixed by the convention or by me. This discord must be silenced.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c010'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The President evidently had learned something from his
recent experience with his friends and subordinates in Louisiana.
General Steele from his headquarters at Little Rock
issued on February 29 the following address to the people of
Arkansas:</p>

<p class='c013'>The convention of your citizens, held at Little Rock during the last
month [says this proclamation], has adopted a constitution and submitted
it to you for your approval or rejection. That constitution is based upon
the principles of freedom, and it is for you now to say, by your voluntary
and unbiased action, whether it shall be your fundamental law.
While it may have defects, in the main it is in accordance with the views
of that portion of the people who have been resisting the fratricidal attempts
which have been made during the last three years. The convention
has fixed the 14th day of March next on which to decide this great
question, and the General commanding is only following the instructions
of the Government when he says to you that every facility will be
offered for the expression of your sentiments, uninfluenced by any considerations
save those which affect your own interests and those of your
posterity.... The election will be held and the return be made in
accordance with the schedule adopted by the convention, and no interference
from any quarter will be allowed to prevent the free expression
of the loyal men of the State on that day.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c010'><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The election pursuant to this notice began March 14, 1864,
the polls remaining open for three days. For the constitution
12,177, and against it 226, votes were cast.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c010'><sup>[149]</sup></a> Isaac Murphy,
against whom there was no opposing candidate, was
chosen Governor by 12,430 votes cast by the citizens of more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>than forty counties. As early as March 18 the President
appears to have received from the Governor-elect some favorable
tidings,<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c010'><sup>[150]</sup></a> and on April 27, when more complete returns
had reached him from the same source, he expressed in a
telegram his gratification at the large vote, more than double
that required by the Louisiana Plan, and also at the intelligence
that the State government, including the Legislature,
was organized and in working order.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c010'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Besides a Governor five other officers of the executive and
several members of the judicial branch of government together
with many county officials were chosen.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c010'><sup>[152]</sup></a> At the
same time three Representatives in Congress, T. M. Jacks, A.
A. C. Rogers and J. M. Johnson, were elected from the First,
Second and Third Districts respectively. The Legislature,
composed of twenty-three Senators and fifty-nine members of
Assembly, met on the 11th of April, and during the session,
which ended June 1 succeeding, appointed William Fishback
and Elisha Baxter United States Senators to fill vacancies
caused by the secession of the late incumbents, R. W. Johnson
and William K. Sebastian. After investigation by a committee
of Congress, however, they were declared not entitled to
seats; but as each possessed such a title to membership as to
justify inquiry they were paid mileage. This consideration
they were denied when, without new action, they subsequently
presented themselves at a special session of the Senate; on that
occasion they were accompanied by William D. Snow, who
had been chosen to succeed Fishback. It was agreed, March 9,
1865, to postpone till the next session of Congress consideration
of the credentials of Mr. Snow. The House, without admitting
as Representatives the three claimants for seats, had
consented to allow them mileage. Arkansas, unlike Louisiana
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and Tennessee, did not participate in the Presidential election
of 1864, because of a feeling that its electoral vote would not
be received even if offered. This course appears to have been
adopted on the suggestion of their representatives, who returned
with such a conviction from a sojourn in Washington.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c010'><sup>[153]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A succeeding chapter, in tracing the origin and progress of
the controversy between the Executive and Legislative
branches of Government, will describe more fully the attitude
of Congress toward Mr. Lincoln’s efforts at reconstruction
and afford an opportunity for discussing both the nature of
the conventions by which civil government had been restored
in Tennessee, Louisiana and Arkansas, and the constitutionality
of the various Executive acts by which this reëstablishment
was assisted.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>IV<br /> <span class='large'>VIRGINIA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The Federal Government, as already observed, was constrained
at an early stage of the Civil War to define
its attitude toward loyal citizens of the seceding
States. The earliest indications of the policy adopted may be
discerned in the case of Virginia, which presents the only instance
of a people in any of the insurrectionary States organizing
open resistance to revolution. All departments of government
in that Commonwealth having gone over to rebellion,
the loyal minority were left without any organization for
the conduct of domestic affairs. In these circumstances they
called a convention which by an original act of sovereignty reconstituted
the government. The progress of the conflict was
attended in that State by consequences not elsewhere observed,
and it is chiefly because of this fact that a slight departure from
exact chronological order is believed to be justified. The
principles which guided the Administration will be easily
comprehended by considering their application to the novel
and somewhat embarrassing questions that arose before rebellion
was finally crushed within the borders of that once
glorious Commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Convention of Virginia” which, by authority of the
Legislature, assembled at Richmond, February 13, 1861,
passed on April 17 following an ordinance of secession from
the United States.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c010'><sup>[154]</sup></a> Though the injunction of secrecy was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>never removed from this proceeding, the tally, discovered
soon after among the private papers of a member, shows that
88 delegates favored and 55 opposed the measure; one was
excused from voting, eight were either absent or silent.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c010'><sup>[155]</sup></a>
This strong opposition is explained in part by the physical
characteristics of the State.</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal chain of the Alleghanies formed in the western
portion of the Old Dominion a lofty range which parts
the streams finding their way into the Ohio and the Potomac
from those that reach the lower waters of Chesapeake Bay
or the sounds of North Carolina. The country southeast of
this ridge, including the Shenandoah Valley, the Piedmont
district, the middle division and the tide-water region, contained
about three fourths of the white inhabitants, and something
less than three fourths of the area, of Virginia. In this
section were found many large tobacco plantations cultivated
almost exclusively by negroes. Indeed, it was in the light
soil of the tide-water counties of Virginia that English
settlers in America first attempted, nearly two and one half
centuries before, the memorable experiment of African slave
labor. Soon after 1808, when their importation was prohibited
by act of Congress, slaves were bred in Virginia to
supply the demand of Southern markets, and by 1860 the
bondmen in that Commonwealth had become almost two
thirds as numerous as the master race.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c010'><sup>[156]</sup></a> It is sufficiently accurate
to say that the triangular district bounded on the north
by the winding course of the Potomac, by the parallel of 36°
31′ on the south and stretching from the Atlantic to the crest
of the Alleghany mountains, comprised all that part of “the
good old commonwealth” which was then either historically
important or interesting. This prolific soil was the birthplace
of many of America’s most illustrious sons; its inhabitants for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the most part were proud to trace their descent from the
earliest settlers along the James; many were wealthy, and all
had long been distinguished for their hospitality.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beyond this favored region the country, which slopes
gradually down to the upper Potomac and the Ohio, is
marked by a succession of parallel ranges separated by fertile
valleys; but like the large tract which encircled the Adirondacks
and a similar one in northern Pennsylvania, the Virginian
wilderness remained untouched by the ceaseless tide of
immigration which at the close of the Revolution swept westward
from the Atlantic seaboard. For this uninviting region
the second Federal census indicates less than two inhabitants
to the square mile; by 1810 pioneers from the line of the Ohio
river encroached on its silent forests. At the next census,
however, a portion was still unoccupied, but in the succeeding
decennial period it received from various points, chiefly from
Pennsylvania, Ohio and New England, many enterprising
and thrifty settlers. The sixth census, that of 1840, represents
the entire tract as sparsely inhabited.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c010'><sup>[157]</sup></a> Its abundant resources,
then but little developed, subsequently gave rise to a great
variety of profitable industries, and it advanced rapidly in
population. Extensive plantations, however, were few; the
number of slaves, owing somewhat to the facility for escape,
had always been small, and in the ten years preceding the outbreak
of hostilities had actually diminished by upwards of two
thousand.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c010'><sup>[158]</sup></a> Though it then contained nearly one fourth of the
whites, it included no more than one thirtieth of the negroes
in the State. Their labor, too, except in other than agricultural
occupations, afforded little remuneration. In consequence
of its productions as well as its location both the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>interests and sympathies of the people were with the adjoining
States of Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, apart from geographical considerations, northwestern
Virginia had a grievance of long standing: for years its inhabitants
had complained that they were not fairly represented
in the Legislature, and the immunity from taxation
enjoyed by their fellow-citizens east of the mountains was a
discrimination too gross to escape attention. The slave
oligarchy, they declared, possessed and wielded for its own
advantage the political power of the State. The question of
its dismemberment had been discussed as early as 1829–30,
when the mountain sons of Virginia were on the verge of
revolution. The East then yielded a pittance of power, which,
though far short of the demands of justice, reconciled western
Virginians for the time. In 1850 they were again on the
point of insurrection. On this occasion adequate representation
was conceded in the lower though withheld in the upper
chamber of the General Assembly, the dominant party thus
retaining control of that body as well as the benefits of a constitutional
provision by which slaves under the age of twelve
years were exempt from taxation, and of those liable to assessment
none could be valued at more than three hundred dollars
even if worth in the market a thousand dollars or upwards.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c010'><sup>[159]</sup></a>
Moreover, much of the public revenue was expended upon internal
improvements for the eastern section of the State. The
Shenandoah Valley, at one time showing signs of discontent,
was bound by the construction of railways, in social as well as
in commercial life, more firmly to Richmond. In short, the
Alleghanies formed a barrier almost completely cutting off
intercourse between the two divisions. Their relations were
well expressed by Governor Pierpont, who told Senator Wade
that there was no communication whatever between the
people except the furnishing a few members to the Legislature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and a few inmates of the penitentiary.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c010'><sup>[160]</sup></a> Their different interests
tended to alienate the sections; the hand of nature had
traced the line of separation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, however, that a crisis was impending, the Richmond
authorities, to harmonize every element within their Commonwealth,
were willing to forego this privilege; to share the
burdens of State administration, to meet State liabilities, and
generally to place themselves on a footing of equality with
their fellow-citizens along the Ohio. This concession, by a
majority of 50,000, was actually extorted in an election from
the prudence or the fears of disunionists whose magnanimity
was duly emphasized by Governor Letcher in an appeal to
the people of the northwest.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c010'><sup>[161]</sup></a> The latter refused, notwithstanding,
to acquiesce in the action of the secession convention
which, so far as it was able to do so, carried their State, as a
political organization, out of the Union.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be affirmed generally that the professional politicians
and large property owners of this region were disloyal;<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c010'><sup>[162]</sup></a>
State officials with surprising unanimity were ardent advocates
of secession and active in committing their Commonwealth
to its support. An overwhelming proportion of the
plain people, however, were devotedly attached to the Union
and determined on its preservation. Therefore when the
Richmond State government attempted to execute its laws in
these parts it encountered the most spirited resistance.
Especially was this true in the Pan Handle counties, where
opposition was promptly organized.</p>

<p class='c000'>Probably the first consultation upon the grave questions
that had arisen was held at the Court House in Wellsburgh,
Brooke County, where a large number of citizens from that
and the adjacent county of Hancock assembled to hear the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>report of Mr. Campbell Tarr, their delegate to Richmond.
From Harrison came Hon. John S. Carlile, who, like Mr.
Tarr, narrowly escaped with his life from that city, where
he had represented his county in the convention. They reported
the proceedings of that body and urged immediate
preparation to resist. As a result of this discussion a committee
of four was appointed to procure arms and ammunition
in Washington. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En route</span></i> thither they had an interview
at Harrisburg with Governor Curtin, who not only expressed
sympathy with their object, but promised assistance if necessary.
On arriving at the national capital they called upon Hon.
Edwin M. Stanton, who was a native of Steubenville, Ohio,
and a warm personal friend of each member of the committee.
They were immediately presented to Mr. Cameron, Secretary
of War, who, on learning the purpose of their visit, manifested
some hesitation as to his legal right to comply with their
request. Upon this Mr. Stanton declared with emphasis that
“the law of <em>necessity</em> gives the right,” and added, “let them
have arms and ammunition; we will look for the book law
afterwards.”<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c010'><sup>[163]</sup></a> Two thousand rifles with suitable ammunition
were then furnished, and as security for their proper
use Mr. Stanton tendered his own name. From Wellsburgh,
where they were temporarily kept in expectation of a rebel
attack, these arms were sent for distribution to Wheeling.</p>

<p class='c000'>United States troops from Ohio and Indiana together with
local volunteers soon drove the Confederate forces from this
region, and subsequently, though often menaced, it was almost
exempt from the ravages of war.<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c010'><sup>[164]</sup></a> Thus encouraged,
Union men resolved to form a political organization coextensive
with Virginia or to establish a separate and distinct State.
Preliminary movements toward that end were promptly inaugurated,
and, April 22, 1861, five days after the passage of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>the ordinance, nearly 1,200 citizens of Clarksburgh denounced
in a public meeting the action of the secession convention
and recommended the people of northwestern Virginia
to assemble on May 13 at Wheeling. On the 4th a
Union mass meeting had been held at Kingwood, near the
northern border. The separation of western from eastern
Virginia was declared by this body to be essential to the maintenance
of their liberties. They also resolved to elect a Representative
to Congress. On the following day there convened
at Wheeling another assemblage, which considered the question
of separating from that portion of the State in rebellion.
About the same time other gatherings were held in different
localities.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were thousands of eager and earnest patriots in the
city of Wheeling on May 13, when nearly four hundred delegates,
mostly appointed by primary meetings, and representing
twenty-six counties, assembled to deliberate on the situation.
The best method of organizing opposition to treason
was the question: how to inaugurate a government which
the Federal authorities would recognize and protect?<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c010'><sup>[165]</sup></a> On
this important subject there is said to have been considerable
diversity of opinion; the decision finally reached was based
upon a suggestion by one of the members that since Governor
Letcher and other State officers, by adhering to the pretended
ordinance of secession, had forfeited their powers, and the
existing constitution made no provision for such an emergency,
the only way was to ask the people, the source of all
political power, to send delegates to a convention authorized
to supply their places with loyal men. This proposal was
presented to the meeting and adopted with great unanimity.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c010'><sup>[166]</sup></a>
A General State Committee, empowered to appoint sub-committees
in all counties where practicable, was then named,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>and a stirring address put forth. It announced their purpose
and urged all loyal citizens to elect representatives to a second
convention. Copies of this appeal were sent to influential citizens
throughout the State, and it was agreed after a session of
three days to choose on May 26 delegates to the proposed
convention.</p>

<p class='c000'>This election having been held at the time appointed, representatives
from nearly forty counties assembled at Wheeling
on June 11. The convention, numbering 98 members,
organized by selecting for its president Hon Arthur I. Boreman.
Before proceeding to business the following oath was
administered to the delegation from each county: “We
solemnly declare that we will support the Constitution of the
United States and the laws made in pursuance thereof, as the
supreme law of the land, anything in the Ordinance of the
Convention that assembled in Richmond on the 13th day of
February last to the contrary notwithstanding, so help us
God.”<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c010'><sup>[167]</sup></a> The State government was reconstituted on the 13th
by an ordinance declaring vacant all places, whether legislative,
executive or judicial, whose incumbents had espoused the
cause of secession. This class, as already observed, included
nearly every official in Virginia. These vacancies the convention
supplied by the appointment of loyal men. In the constitution
they made an important alteration which prescribed
the number of delegates necessary to constitute a quorum in
the General Assembly. All State, county and town officials
were required to take an oath of allegiance which pledged
support of both the Federal Constitution and the restored
government of Virginia. On June 17 a declaration of independence
was adopted without one dissenting voice; it denounced
the usurpation of the Richmond convention, which
had assumed to place the resources of Virginia at the disposal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>of the Confederate Government, to which power it repudiated
allegiance. Resolutions expressing a determination never to
submit to the ordinance of secession, but to maintain the rights
of Virginia in the Union, were then passed. All persons in
arms against the national Government were commanded to
disband and to return to their allegiance. Though the members
seriously endeavored to reorganize their government, it
was with an express declaration that a division of the Commonwealth
was a paramount object of their labors, and they
decided, June 20, by a unanimous vote in favor of ultimate
separation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under an ordinance previously adopted Hon. Francis H.
Pierpont was chosen Governor on the same day; a lieutenant-governor,
an attorney-general and an executive council of five
were also appointed. Other administrative offices were subsequently
filled. The new incumbents were to exercise their
functions for six months or until successors should be elected
and qualified. The convention on June 25, subject in an emergency
to be reassembled by the Governor and Council, then
adjourned to August 6, 1861.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before concluding this session the convention directed all
members willing to swear fealty to the Union, who were
elected to the assembly on May 23 preceding, to meet on the
1st of July at Wheeling. At the time of their election these
representatives were destined for Richmond. In addition to
those regularly chosen under the old law of the Commonwealth,
others pursuant to an ordinance of the convention
were elected to fill vacancies. All were to qualify themselves
by taking an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the
United States and to the reorganized government of Virginia.
These members, chiefly from the western counties, were to
compose the law-making body, which was invested with all
the powers and duties pertaining to the General Assembly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new Governor was inaugurated on June 20, and, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>taking the oath of office, said: “We have been driven into
the position we occupy to-day by the usurpers at the South,
who have inaugurated this war upon the soil of Virginia, and
have made it the great Crimea of this contest. We, representing
the loyal citizens of Virginia, have been bound to assume
the position we have assumed to-day for the protection of
ourselves, our wives, our children, and our property. We,
I repeat, have been driven to assume this position; and now
we are but recurring to the great fundamental principle of
our fathers, that to the loyal people of a State belongs the
law-making power of that State. The loyal people are entitled
to the government and governmental authority of the
State. And, fellow-citizens, it is the assumption of that authority
upon which we are now about to enter.”<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c010'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“It was not the object of the Wheeling convention,” he declared
on a later occasion, “to set up any new government in
the State, or separate, or other government than the one
under which they had always lived.”<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c010'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>From these utterances his hearers must have concluded that
the reorganized government was not for a part but for the
whole of Virginia. Indeed, it was to the discernment of Mr.
Pierpont that Virginia loyalists were chiefly indebted for a
legal solution of the intricate problem that confronted them.
While Carlile and others were urging a counter-revolution,
Mr. Pierpont was carefully studying the provisions of the
Federal Constitution. The clause of that instrument which
guarantees a republican form of government was designed,
he believed, to meet just such an emergency as had arisen.
Though this conservative suggestion was not at first received
with much favor, it continued gradually to win adherents until
its propriety was universally recognized.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c010'><sup>[170]</sup></a> By thus proceeding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>along constitutional lines a State government in all its
branches was soon established in every county not occupied
by an armed foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Legislature of the restored State assembled, July 2, at
Wheeling and assumed the full exercise of its powers. Two
United States Senators, Waitman T. Willey, whose fidelity
many considered doubtful, and John S. Carlile, an able, eloquent
and then a trusted leader, were elected, July 9; the
former to fill the vacancy occasioned by the withdrawal of
James M. Mason, the latter to succeed Robert M. T. Hunter,
who also had abdicated his seat in Congress. Both were
admitted, though not without a vigorous protest from the
minority, to seats at the first session of the Thirty-seventh
Congress, which met on July 4, 1861.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their certificates were presented, July 13, by Andrew Johnson.
Senator Bayard entered a protest. Their admission, he
said, would be a recognition of an organization that was not
the regular government of the Commonwealth. Mr. Letcher
was still Governor of Virginia, his term not having expired.
The Senate had no authority to create a new State out of a
part of an existing one. He then moved to refer their credentials
to the Committee on the Judiciary. His colleague,
Mr. Saulsbury, objected, that Mason and Hunter were not
expelled until July 11, whereas the claimants were appointed
two days previously, at a time when no vacancies had occurred.
To this Senator Johnson replied that the vacancies did in
fact exist at the time of their election, July 9, and that the
expulsion of Mason and Hunter was not merely a declaration
that vacancies existed, but their seats were regarded as filled,
and the occupants expelled from the floor of the Senate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Bayard denied that, even if Mason and Hunter were
guilty of the alleged crimes, there was any power in either
the Governor or Legislature to terminate their appointments;
they might die, they could be removed by expulsion, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>vacancies could not be anticipated by the Legislature of Virginia.
The name of Mr. Pierpont could convey no authority
to their credentials. On the question of reference five Senators
voted in the affirmative, thirty-five in the negative. The oath
was therefore administered and they took their seats, July 13,
at the special session which began on the 4th.<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c010'><sup>[171]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A resolution was passed by the House of Delegates of the
reorganized government instructing the Senators and requesting
their Representatives in Congress to vote the necessary appropriation
of men and money for a vigorous prosecution of
the war, and to oppose all compromise. A stay law was also
enacted by the Legislature, and a bill passed which authorized
the Governor to organize a patrol in such counties as might
require it; two hundred thousand dollars were appropriated
for military purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>On August 6, 1861, the Wheeling convention reassembled.
Hitherto in all its proceedings relative to a reorganization
there had been great unanimity, but when the delegates returned
they were conscious of a strong popular sentiment in
favor of erecting a new State, a subject that had been introduced,
though not much discussed, before adjournment. This
determination among their constituents seriously troubled
many of the members. Political aspirations had been awakened;
many of them had enjoyed the benefits of the humbler
offices under the mother State; the Union forces, it was confidently
expected, would soon crush the insurrection in Virginia,
and the reorganized government, with themselves at its head,
would be acquiesced in by their recent oppressors. To their
ambition this hope was far more flattering than the prospect
of administering the affairs of a comparatively small State
on the western frontier of the Old Dominion. Then, too, the
idea of dismemberment was certain to wound Virginia State
pride. Moreover, the movement to form an independent commonwealth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>when the reorganized government itself had been
scarcely recognized, would look premature. Sentiments of this
nature had begun to possess the minds of many delegates
about the time of their return.</p>

<p class='c000'>In compliance with what appeared to be a popular demand,
however, these considerations were disregarded, and the convention
by a vote of 50 to 28 passed an ordinance authorizing
the formation out of the Commonwealth of Virginia of a new
State to be called Kanawha, which was to embrace thirty-nine
counties between the Alleghanies and the Ohio, provided
the people thereof, at an election to be held on October 24,
should express themselves in favor of such a measure; on certain
prescribed conditions other contiguous counties could be
annexed. At the election which was to decide this important
question delegates to a constitutional convention were also to
be chosen, and, if separation was approved by the people, these
representatives were to assemble at Wheeling on November
26 and organize themselves into a convention. Any constitution
which they might adopt was to be submitted to the
qualified electors of the counties concerned. The new commonwealth
was to assume a just proportion of Virginia’s
public debt as it existed prior to January 1, 1861; private
rights derived from her laws were to be valid under the proposed
State, and were to be determined by the laws then existing
in Virginia.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c010'><sup>[172]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The convention, as previously noted, reassembled on
August 6. Three days later one A. F. Ritchie, a member
from Marion County, forwarded to Attorney-General Bates at
Washington a letter which requested and received an immediate
reply. Mr. Ritchie published the response, of which this
is the important part:</p>

<p class='c013'>The formation of a new State out of Western Virginia is an original,
independent act of <em>revolution</em>. I do not deny the power of revolution (I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>do not call it right, for it is never prescribed; it exists in force only, and
has and can have no law but the will of the revolutionists). Any attempt
to carry it out involves a plain breach of <em>both the constitutions</em>—of Virginia
and of the Nation. And hence it is plain that you cannot take such a
course without weakening, if not destroying, your claims upon the sympathy
and support of the General Government, and without disconcerting
the plan already adopted by both Virginia and the General Government
for the reorganization of the revolted States and the restoration of the
integrity of the Union.</p>

<p class='c013'>That plan I understand to be this: When a State, by its perverted
functionaries, has declared itself out of the Union, we avail ourselves of
all the sound and loyal elements of the State—all who own allegiance to
and claim protection of the Constitution—to form a State government as
nearly as may be upon the former model, and claiming to be the very State
which has been in part overthrown by the successful rebellion. In this
way we establish a constitutional nucleus around which all the shattered
elements of the commonwealth may meet and combine, and thus restore
the old State in its original integrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>This, I verily thought, was the plan adopted at Wheeling, and recognized
and acted upon by the General Government here. Your convention
annulled the revolutionary proceedings at Richmond, both in the
Convention and the General Assembly, and your new Governor formally
demanded of the President the fulfillment of the constitutional guaranty
in favor of Virginia—Virginia as known to our fathers and to us. The
President admitted the obligation, and promised his best efforts to fulfill
it. And the Senate admitted your Senators, not as representing a new
and nameless State, now for the first time heard of in our history, but as
representing “the good old commonwealth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Must all this be undone, and a new and hazardous experiment be ventured
upon, at the moment when dangers and difficulties are thickening
around us? I hope not.... I had rejoiced in the movement in
Western Virginia, as a legal, constitutional, and safe refuge from revolution
and anarchy; as at once an example and fit instrument for the restoration
of all the revolted States.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have not time now to discuss the subject in its various bearings.
What I have written is written with a running pen and will need your
charitable criticism.</p>

<p class='c013'>If I had time to think, I could give persuasive reasons for declining the
attempt to create a new State at this perilous time. At another time I
might be willing to go fully into the question, but now I can say no
more.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c010'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Mr. Ritchie, who had opposed a dismemberment of the old
Commonwealth, was anxious, no doubt, to justify his vote by
the endorsement of an eminent public character, and it is not
improbable that before finally determining his action in so important
a matter he was desirous of the opinion of some member
of the Administration. Mr. Bates’s communication is
dated the 12th; the convention did not adjourn till the 25th of
August. At any time prior to January 1, 1862, it was subject
to be reassembled by its president or by the Governor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The election of October 24, by a vote of 18,408 to 781, decided
in favor of a division of the Commonwealth.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c010'><sup>[174]</sup></a> At the
same time fifty-three delegates, representing forty-one counties,
were chosen to frame a constitution for the proposed
State. Of this convention John Hall was elected president
and Ellery R. Hall secretary. The task before it, by no means
an easy one, was to draft a fundamental law that would secure
the approval of the people of western Virginia, of the
Legislature of the restored State and of Congress. After a
session of nearly three months it adjourned, February 18,
1862. Commissioners to convoke this body, should its work
be recognized by Congress, had first been appointed. On December
3 preceding the name of the new State was changed
to West Virginia.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the convention were many members who desired silence
on the subject of slavery; others saw clearly that to ignore
the cause of their present troubles would ensure a rejection
of their work by Congress. This element felt assured that
the temper of the national Legislature would not indulge
the slave power by giving it two additional Senators besides
an increase of strength in the Electoral College. There
was also a sentiment which desired a postponement of the
disturbing question until all others had first been determined.
The friends of gradual emancipation were warned by leading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Republicans in Congress that the constitution would not be
recognized without a satisfactory provision on this subject.
The “peculiar institution,” however, still possessed influence
enough to defeat such a purpose, and the convention adjourned
without inserting any expression concerning slavery.
Still, the friends of emancipation did not despair. Mr.
Parker, one of these, caused to be printed in Ohio instructions
to their assemblymen to make the following provision a part
of their constitution if the speedy admission of the new State
into the Union should appear to require it: “All children
born of slave mothers in this State, after the constitution
goes into operation, shall be free, males at the age of twenty-eight
years, and females at the age of eighteen years, and the
children of such females to be free at birth.”<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c010'><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This unauthorized action of Mr. Parker, in connection with
appeals through the newspapers, was not without effect. At
their county-seat the citizens of Upshur passed, among other
resolutions, the following: “That we, the citizens of Upshur
County, do endorse and accept the policy recommended by the
present Chief Magistrate of the United States, (Abraham
Lincoln) in his message of the 6th of March, 1862, to Congress,
in regard to the emancipation of the slaves of the
border States, as the policy that should be adopted by the
people of West Virginia; and we do now pledge ourselves
to advocate, defend and carry out the said policy, as the
most promotive of our liberty, safety and prosperity in the
Union.”<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c010'><sup>[176]</sup></a> Another resolution, adopted on this occasion, declared
that the meeting expected the convention would have
given the people an opportunity of expressing their sentiments
on slavery in the proposed State. The convention, they complained,
did not reflect the popular will.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Union men and the loyal press of other counties followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the example of Upshur by approving the measure or
copying the “Instructions.” Thus at the time of voting on
the constitution an informal poll on slavery was obtained in
twenty counties.</p>

<p class='c000'>A faction in the convention proposed to annex the Shenandoah
Valley with its large negro population; the success of
such a plan, it was well understood, would ensure a rejection
of the new State by Congress. To anticipate somewhat the
events presently to be narrated it may be remarked at this
point that the adversaries of the measure in Washington employed
precisely the same tactics to defeat the movement for
erecting an independent State.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new establishment under Pierpont was regarded as representing
the old Commonwealth. On December 2, 1861,
the reorganized Legislature again assembled. The Governor
recommended a repeal of the stay laws and confiscation of the
property of secessionists. He congratulated the people that
they had contributed their full quota, about 6,000 men, to the
Union army.</p>

<p class='c000'>The adversaries of slavery endeavored to obtain the consent
of the restored Legislature to the condition that the
gradual emancipation clause should become a part of the
constitution as soon as ratified by the people. If Congress at
its present session would give its consent and admit the new
State on the same condition, the people, they declared, could
be trusted to ratify afterward.</p>

<p class='c000'>An election held April 3, 1862, gave, including the soldiers’
vote, 28,321 for and 572 against the constitution, no
returns being received from ten counties.<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c010'><sup>[177]</sup></a> The vote for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>gradual emancipation, where an expression was had, was
almost equal to that given for the constitution, both being
nearly unanimous. The former received 6,052 for and 610
against it. How far this informal expression of opinion
influenced Congress will presently be noticed.</p>

<p class='c000'>At an extra session of the Legislature, convoked by Governor
Pierpont, an act, in almost the identical language of that
assenting to the formation of Kentucky, was passed, May 13,
1862, giving consent to the erection within the jurisdiction of
Virginia of a new State to include forty-eight named counties;
the second section of this act provided that Berkeley,
Jefferson and Frederic counties could be annexed whenever a
majority of their votes, at an election to be held for that purpose,
should ratify the constitution. The act, together with
a certified original of the constitution, was to be transmitted
to their Senators and Representatives in Washington, who
were requested to use their endeavors to obtain the consent of
Congress to the admission of West Virginia into the
Union.</p>

<p class='c000'>On June 23, 1862, Mr. Wade, from the Committee on
Territories, reported to the United States Senate a bill for the
admission of West Virginia into the Union, and three days
later requested its consideration. It stipulated, among other
things, that “the convention thereinafter provided for shall,
in the constitution to be framed by it, make provision that
from and after the fourth day of July, 1863, the children of
all slaves born within the limits of the State shall be free”;
it also allotted to the new Commonwealth as many Representatives
in Congress as her population would justify under
the apportionment then existing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles Sumner observed that the former was the imposition
of a condition which proposed to recognize the existence
of slavery during that generation. “Short as life may be,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>he declared, “it is too long for slavery.” By the admission of
West Virginia a new slave State would be added; he moved,
therefore, to substitute for this requirement the Jeffersonian
interdict that “within the limits of said State there shall be
neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, otherwise than in
punishment of crime whereof the party shall be duly convicted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Hale justly remarked that after consenting to the
admission of so many States with pro-slavery constitutions
it would be a singular fact if the first that ever applied
with a provision for prospective emancipation should be
rejected.</p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Collamer believed that if West Virginia was to
enter on a footing of perfect equality with other members
of the Union she should, like them, have the right to regulate
domestic questions, including slavery, in her own way. The
condition imposed by the bill denied her that right.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Wade disliked the proposition as it stood, because
it was very objectionable to him “to say that a man born on
the 4th day of July, 1863, shall be free, and one born the day
before shall be forever a slave.” “I should much prefer,”
he added, “to have it graduated so that all born after the
adoption of this constitution shall be free, and that all between
certain ages shall be free at a certain period.” At this point
Sumner’s amendment was lost by a vote of 24 to 11.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Carlile, of Virginia, who was foremost in organizing
resistance to secession, had from the beginning assumed the
appearance of a friend, but, after giving direction to the movement
for separation, acted as an adversary to the new State;
he opposed all conditions on its admission and expressed a
preference that it be permitted to enter on the constitution
submitted by its people. He would never “consent to have
the organic law of a State framed for its people by the Congress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>of the United States.” There were 47,000 voters in
the counties to be embraced within the proposed State; of
that number only about 19,000 had voted on the constitution.
At the last moment he delivered with his usual eloquence a
strong argument against admission. An amendment which
he submitted would have the effect certainly to postpone,
perhaps altogether to defeat, the measure in the Senate. Failing
to secure its adoption, he urged a postponement till December
following; this motion, however, was voted down.</p>

<p class='c000'>So surprised were his associates at this unexpected opposition
that they inquired pointedly why these belated arguments
had not been presented to the Committee on Territories
when the measure was before them. Mr. Wade, its
chairman, was especially severe in his condemnation of Carlile’s
extraordinary course, for it was the reasoning of the
Virginia Senator that had won their support; he had searched
the precedents and submitted cheerfully to all the labors imposed
by the Committee. Now by his opposition he brought
everything to a stand-still.</p>

<p class='c000'>His colleague, Mr. Willey, who had been converted in a
rather advanced stage of the movement, declared that it was
not the desire to be free from that part of the Commonwealth
in rebellion that was responsible for the present attitude of
western Virginia; the insurrection only precipitated the attempt
to settle a controversy which was older than he. To
enforce his remarks he added that great numbers of her citizens
had determined to fix their abodes elsewhere unless
West Virginia became an independent State. During this
discussion the Senate had before it the constitution framed
by the convention which met November 26, 1861, in the city
of Wheeling.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a vigorous address by Benjamin F. Wade, who had
recently investigated the subject, and whose ardor had been
aroused by a deputation of West Virginians then in Washington,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the bill by a vote of 23 to 17 passed the Senate,
July 14, 1862.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c010'><sup>[178]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>By Mr. Brown, of Virginia, a similar measure had already
been introduced into the House on June 25. It was read
twice and referred to the Committee on Territories.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c010'><sup>[179]</sup></a> When
called up on July 16 succeeding it was agreed to postpone
consideration of the bill until the regular session in December,<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c010'><sup>[180]</sup></a>
and on the 9th of that month, when Representative
Bingham asked that it be put on its passage, discussion of
the subject was resumed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Representative Conway said that if the application of
West Virginia came in the proper manner he would be happy
to vote for its admission; he regretted, however, that at
the beginning of the rebellion a territorial government had
not been organized there; Congress could then have passed
an enabling act, and the State could be received in a manner
to admit of no dispute. The question turned, he declared,
on whether the State of Virginia, of which a Mr. Pierpont
was Governor, was the lawful State. This he denied. A
number of persons without authority met at Wheeling and
organized a government. This establishment the President
had recognized; one branch of Congress by admitting its
Senators had also conceded its legality. These precedents,
however, should not be binding on the House. Neither mobs
nor mass-meetings, he asserted, make laws under our system,
and such bodies had no authority to appoint Mr.
Pierpont.</p>

<p class='c000'>The President intended, Mr. Conway believed, to form
similar organizations in all the seceded States. “A policy
seems about to be inaugurated,” he added, “looking to an
assumption of State powers by a few individuals, wherever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>a military or other encampment can be effected in any of the
rebellious districts. The utter and flagrant unconstitutionality
of this scheme—I may say, its radically revolutionary
character—ought to expose it to the reprobation of every
loyal citizen and every member of this House. It aims at an
utter subversion of our constitutional system. Its effect
would be to consolidate all the powers of the Government
in the hands of the Executive. With the admission of this
new State, the President will have substantially <em>created</em> four
Senators—two for Virginia and two for West Virginia.”
In referring to an extension of this system he declared that
the President and a few friends could exercise Federal authority
in all those States. “The true policy of this Government,
therefore, with regard to the seceded States, is to hold
them as common territory wherever and whenever our arms
are extended over them. This obviates the terrible dangers
which I have alluded to, and is in harmony with the highest
considerations of public utility, as well as with sound legal
principles.”<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c010'><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Conway directed his criticisms against the President
because he believed the Executive was first to recognize
the new government. The action of the Senate was based
upon this precedent, it being assumed that recognition was
an Executive function.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Brown, who introduced the bill at the preceding
session, related concisely the essential facts already placed
before the reader. He reminded Representative Conway
that, though a State could not commit treason, or any other
crime, the officials of government could do so; that the legislative
powers, being incapable of annihilation, returned to the
people; that the spontaneous assembly at Wheeling merely
organized and proposed a plan by which regular elections
were to be held to fill vacancies caused by the withdrawal of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>disloyal representatives. A day was fixed, and wherever
throughout the State loyal citizens chose to hold an election
they could do so. The body thus elected assumed the legislative
functions of the people.</p>

<p class='c000'>In answer to an inquiry he replied that about five counties
outside of West Virginia were represented in the Legislature
which consented to the erection of the new State, and all
the counties in the State were expressly invited to send representatives
to the General Assembly. If they were loyal
they should have coöperated; if not, they should have no
voice in either the State Legislature or Congress. He referred
in his remarks to a telegram which he had that morning
received from Wheeling. It contained a resolution
passed by the Assembly asking the House of Representatives
to approve the bill for the admission of West Virginia, which
had been favorably acted upon by the Senate at the preceding
session.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It has been asserted,” he said in conclusion, “and understood
in some quarters, that the organization of the government
at Wheeling was for the purpose of forming a new
State. I am prepared to say that when the convention
originally met in Wheeling, although there were a few
radicals there who wanted to form a new State without reinstating
the old State of Virginia, we voted them down, and
commenced the exercise of our original rights as freemen to
build up the loyal government of Virginia; and although
we designed eventually to ask for this separation, and it was
what we anxiously desired, yet we determined to be a law-abiding
people, and ask for what we desired through the
forms of law.”<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c010'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Representative Colfax in giving the reasons which should
govern his vote stated that the restored government had
been recognized by the Senate, by the President as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>other executive officers, and that the House, by admitting
Mr. Segar, elected pursuant to a proclamation of Governor
Pierpont, had also recognized the reorganized State. Even
the political party in opposition voted for that member’s admission.
He also remarked that the new State came knocking
at the door for admission with the tiara of freedom on
her brow.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c010'><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Olin, who opposed the bill at the preceding session,
said: “I shall vote for it now with reluctance. I shall vote
for it mainly upon the ground that the General Government,
whether wisely or unwisely I will not undertake to say, has
encouraged this movement to create a division of the State
of Virginia.”<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c010'><sup>[184]</sup></a> The people of West Virginia, with their experience
of the evils which slavery brought on them, should
not have permitted that institution to exist for an hour in
their new government. For this deficiency, however, the bill
provided a partial remedy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crittenden observed that it was the party applying for admission
that gave its consent to a division of the State.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c010'><sup>[185]</sup></a> To
this objection Representative Blair replied that there were
counties outside of West Virginia which had assented to dismemberment.
Other members, who had hitherto been hostile,
now consented to support the measure from a conviction
that it would weaken rebellion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Representative Dawes said that the primary elections which
sent delegates to the Wheeling convention discussed not a
reorganization of the Virginia government, but the formation
of an independent State in western Virginia. To accomplish
that, he said, the only way was to restore the government of
the entire Commonwealth. That government then had two
things to do: to set up a new State within itself and secondly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>to give its consent thereto. This suggestion, he understood,
emanated from Washington.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c010'><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In reference to the admission, Thaddeus Stevens said:</p>

<p class='c013'>I do not desire to be understood as being deluded by the idea that we
are admitting this State in pursuance of any provisions of the Constitution.
I find no such provision that justifies it, and the argument in favor
of the constitutionality of it is one got up by those who either honestly
entertain, I think, an erroneous opinion, or who desire to justify, by a
forced construction, an act which they have predetermined to do.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Now, to say that the Legislature which called this seceding convention
was not the Legislature of Virginia, is asserting that the Legislature
chosen by a vast majority of the people of a State is not the Legislature
of that State. That is a doctrine which I can never assent to. I admit
that the Legislature were disloyal, but they were still the disloyal and
traitorous Legislature of the State of Virginia; and the State, as a mere
State, was bound by their acts. Not so individuals. They are responsible
to the General Government, and are responsible whether the State
decrees treason or not. That being the Legislature of Virginia, Governor
Letcher, elected by a majority of the votes of the people, is the Governor
of Virginia—a traitor in rebellion, but a traitorous governor of a traitorous
State. Now, then, how has that State ever given its consent to this
division? A highly respectable but very small number of the citizens of
Virginia—the people of West Virginia—assembled together, disapproved
of the acts of the State of Virginia, and with the utmost self-complacency
called themselves Virginia.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>I hold that none of the States now in rebellion are entitled to the protection
of the Constitution, and I am grieved when I hear those high in
authority sometimes talking of the constitutional difficulties about enforcing
measures against this belligerent power, and the next moment
disregarding every vestige and semblance of the Constitution by acts
which alone are arbitrary. I hope I do not differ with the Executive in
the views which I advocate. But I see the Executive one day saying “you
shall not take the property of rebels to pay the debts which the rebels
have brought upon the Northern States.” Why? Because the Constitution
is in the way. And the next day I see him appointing a military
governor of Virginia, a military governor of Tennessee, and some other
places. Where does he find anything in the Constitution to warrant
that?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>If he must look there alone for authority, then all these acts are flagrant
usurpations, deserving the condemnation of the community. He must
agree with me or else his acts are as absurd as they are unlawful; for I
see him here and there ordering elections for members of Congress wherever
he finds a little collection of three or four consecutive plantations
in the rebel States, in order that men may be sent in here to control the
proceedings of this Congress, just as we sanctioned the election held by
a few people at a little watering place at Fortress Monroe, by which we
have here the very respectable and estimable member from that locality
with us. It was upon the same principle.</p>

<p class='c013'>... I say, then, that we may admit West Virginia as a new State,
not by virtue of any provision of the Constitution, but under our absolute
power which the laws of war give us in the circumstances in which we
are placed. I shall vote for this bill upon that theory, and upon that
alone; for I will not stultify myself by supposing that we have any warrant
in the Constitution for this proceeding.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Union, he declared, could never be restored as it was.
His consent would never be given to restore it with a constitutional
provision protecting slavery. An additional reason
for giving his vote in favor of the bill was that there was
a provision which would make West Virginia a free State.<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c010'><sup>[187]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“No right of persons, no right of property,” said Mr.
Noell, “no social or domestic affairs, could be regulated or
controlled by the people of western Virginia, under the circumstances
in which they were placed, without recognizing
the ordinance of secession, and acting as a State within the
Southern Confederacy.”<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c010'><sup>[188]</sup></a> This showed both the necessity of
reorganizing the government of Virginia and the recognition
by Federal authorities of the establishment so constituted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Segar declared that eleven of the forty-eight counties
to comprise the new State had not participated in its establishment,
being represented neither in the reorganized Legislature
nor the Wheeling convention; three others were unrepresented
both in the House of Delegates and the conventions;
ten cast no vote on the constitution and three had interests,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>social and commercial, which bound them up with the
East. Then, too, the people of West Virginia made a fundamental
law recognizing slavery; an anti-slavery constitution
was to be imposed on them as a condition of admission.<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c010'><sup>[189]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>An able argument by Representative Bingham, of Ohio,
who had charge of the bill, concluded the debate on December
10, 1862, when it passed by 96 yeas to 55 nays.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c010'><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>With the President rested the fate of this important measure;
if he vetoed it there would, probably, not be found a two
thirds majority in its support. Many members, as will be
seen from the preceding abridgment of the debates, yielded
only a reluctant support.</p>

<p class='c000'>On December 23, 1862, Mr. Lincoln sent to his constitutional
advisers the following note:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Gentlemen of the Cabinet</span>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A bill for an act entitled “An act for the admission of the State of
West Virginia into the Union and for other purposes” has passed the
House of Representatives and the Senate, and has been duly presented
to me for my action.</p>

<p class='c013'>I respectfully ask of each of you an opinion in writing on the following
questions, to wit:</p>

<p class='c013'>1st. Is the said act constitutional?</p>

<p class='c013'>2d. Is the said act expedient?<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c010'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>To this request six members of the Cabinet responded by
submitting their written opinions. Three—Seward, Stanton
and Chase—answered both questions in the affirmative.
Bates, Blair and Welles replied in the negative; the remaining
place in the Cabinet was vacant owing to the resignation of
Caleb B. Smith, Secretary of the Interior, who had been raised
to the Bench in Indiana. His successor had not yet been
appointed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Upon the constitutional point Mr. Seward said: “It seems
to me that the political body which has given consent in this
case is really and incontestably the State of Virginia. So
long as the United States do not recognize the secession, departure,
or separation of one of the States, that State must
be deemed as existing and having a constitutional place within
the Union, whatever may be at any moment exactly its revolutionary
condition. A State thus situated cannot be deemed
to be divided into two or more States merely by any revolutionary
proceeding which may have occurred, because there
cannot be, constitutionally, two or more States of Virginia....
The newly organized State of Virginia is therefore,
at this moment, by the express consent of the United
States, invested with all the rights of the State of Virginia,
and charged with all the powers, privileges, and dignity of
that State. If the United States allow to that organization
any of these rights, powers, and privileges, it must be allowed
to possess and enjoy them all. If it be a State competent to
be represented in Congress and bound to pay taxes, it is a
State competent to give the required consent of the State to
the formation and erection of the new State of West Virginia
within the jurisdiction of Virginia.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Upon the question of expediency,” he wrote, “I am determined
by two considerations. First. The people of Western
Virginia will be safer from molestation for their loyalty,
because better able to protect and defend themselves as a new
and separate State than they would be if left to demoralizing
uncertainty upon the question whether, in the progress of the
war, they may not be again reabsorbed in the State of Virginia,
and subjected to severities as a punishment for their
present devotion to the Union. The first duty of the United
States is protection to loyalty wherever it is found. Second.
I am of opinion that the harmony and peace of the Union
will be promoted by allowing the new State to be formed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>erected, which will assume jurisdiction over that part of the
valley of the Ohio which lies on the south side of the Ohio
River, displacing, in a constitutional and lawful manner, the
jurisdiction heretofore exercised there by a political power
concentrated at the head of the James River.”<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c010'><sup>[192]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Chase, in discussing the constitutional question, said in
part: “The Madison Papers clearly show that the consent of
the Legislature of the original State was the only consent required
to the erection and formation of a new State within its
jurisdiction. That consent having been given, the consent
of the new State, if required, is proved by her application for
admission.... The Legislature of Virginia, it may
be admitted, did not contain many members from the eastern
counties; it contained, however, representatives from all counties
whose inhabitants were not either rebels themselves, or
dominated by greater numbers of rebels. It was the only
Legislature of the State known to the Union. If its consent
was not valid, no consent could be. If its consent was not
valid, the Constitution, as to the people of West Virginia,
has been so suspended by the rebellion that a most important
right under it is utterly lost.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Relative to the question of expediency, he writes: “The
act is almost universally regarded as of vital importance to
their welfare by the loyal people most immediately interested,
and it has received the sanction of large majorities in both
Houses of Congress. These facts afford strong presumptions
of expediency.... It may be said, indeed, that the
admission of West Virginia will draw after it the necessity
of admitting other States under the consent of extemporized
legislatures assuming to act for whole States, though really
representing no important part of their territory. I think this
necessity imaginary. There is no such legislature, nor is
there likely to be. No such legislature, if extemporized, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>likely to receive the recognition of Congress or the Executive.”<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c010'><sup>[193]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Stanton responded more briefly than either Secretary
Seward or Secretary Chase, observing, among other things:
“I have been unable to perceive any point on which the act of
Congress conflicts with the Constitution. By the erection of the
new State, the geographical boundary heretofore existing
between the free and slave States will be broken, and the
advantage of this upon every point of consideration surpasses
all objections which have occurred to me on the question of
expediency. Many prophetic dangers and evils might be
specified, but it is safe to suppose that those who come after
us will be as wise as ourselves, and if what we deem evils
be really such, they will be avoided. The present good is real
and substantial, the future may safely be left in the care of
those whose duty and interest may be involved in any possible
future measures of legislation.”<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c010'><sup>[194]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>One or two excerpts from the opinion of Mr. Welles will
indicate the course of his argument in the negative: “Under
existing necessities, an organization of the loyal citizens, or of
a portion of them, has been recognized, and its Senators and
Representatives admitted to seats in Congress. Yet we cannot
close our eyes to the fact that the fragment of the State
which, in the revolutionary tumult, has instituted the new
organization, is not possessed of the records, archives,
symbols, traditions, or capital of the Commonwealth. Though
calling itself the State of Virginia, it does not assume the
debts and obligations contracted prior to the existing difficulties.
Is this organization, then, really and in point of fact anything
else than a provisional government for the State? It
is composed almost entirely of those loyal citizens who reside
beyond the mountains, and within the prescribed limits of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>proposed new State. In this revolutionary period, there being
no contestants, we are compelled to recognize the organization
as Virginia. Whether that would be the case, and how the
question would be met and disposed of, were the insurrection
this day abandoned, need not now be discussed. Were Virginia,
or those parts of it not included in the proposed new
State, invaded and held in temporary subjection by a foreign
enemy instead of the insurgents, the fragment of territory and
population which should successfully repel the enemy and
adhere to the Union would doubtless, during such temporary
subjection, be recognized, and properly recognized, as Virginia.
When, however, this loyal fragment goes farther, and
not only declares itself to be Virginia, but proceeds by its
own act to detach itself permanently and forever from the
Commonwealth, and to erect itself into a new State within the
jurisdiction of the State of Virginia, the question arises
whether this proceeding is regular, legal, right, and, in honest
good faith, conformable to, and within the letter and spirit
of the Constitution.... Congress may admit new
States into the Union; but any attempt to dismember or divide
a State by any forced or unauthorized assumption would be
an inexpedient exercise of doubtful power to the injury of
such State. Were there no question of doubtful constitutionality
in the movement, the time selected for the division of
the State is most inopportune. It is a period of civil commotion,
when unity and concerted action on the part of all loyal
citizens and authorities should be directed to a restoration
of the Union, and all tendency towards disintegration and
demoralization avoided.”<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c010'><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Blair, likewise in the negative, added little of importance
to what Secretary Welles had adduced on that side.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first and rather hastily formed opinion of Attorney-General
Bates has already been given together with an account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>of the circumstances attending its publication; upon longer
reflection he did not greatly change the ground of his original
convictions and in an elaborate discussion still reasoned in the
negative.<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c010'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Between these evenly balanced and conflicting opinions of
his advisers Mr. Lincoln argued as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>The consent of the legislature of Virginia is constitutionally necessary
to the bill for the admission of West Virginia becoming a law. A body
claiming to be such legislature has given its consent. We cannot well
deny that it is such, unless we do so upon the outside knowledge that the
body was chosen at elections in which a majority of the qualified voters
of Virginia did not participate. But it is a universal practice in the popular
elections in all these States to give no legal consideration whatever
to those who do not choose to vote, as against the effect of the votes of
those who do choose to vote. Hence it is not the qualified voters, but
the qualified voters who choose to vote that constitute the political power
of the State. Much less than to non-voters should any consideration be
given to those who did not vote in this case, because it is also matter
of outside knowledge that they were not merely neglectful of their rights
under and duty to this government, but were also engaged in open rebellion
against it. Doubtless among these non-voters were some Union men
whose voices were smothered by the more numerous secessionists; but
we know too little of their number to assign them any appreciable value.
Can this government stand, if it indulges constitutional constructions by
which men in open rebellion against it are to be accounted, man for man,
the equals of those who maintain their loyalty to it? Are they to be
accounted even better citizens, and more worthy of consideration, than
those who merely neglect to vote? If so, their treason against the Constitution
enhances their constitutional value. Without braving these absurd
conclusions, we cannot deny that the body which consents to the
admission of West Virginia is the legislature of Virginia. I do not think
the plural form of the words “legislatures” and “States” in the phrase
of the Constitution “without the consent of the legislatures of the States
concerned,” etc., has any reference to the new State concerned. That
plural form sprang from the contemplation of two or more old States contributing
to form a new one. The idea that the new State was in danger
of being admitted without its own consent was not provided against,
because it was not thought of, as I conceive. It is said, the devil takes
care of his own. Much more should a good spirit—the spirit of the
Constitution and the Union—take care of its own. I think it cannot do
less and live.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>But is the admission into the Union of West Virginia expedient? This,
in my general view, is more a question for Congress than for the Executive.
Still I do not evade it. More than on anything else, it depends on
whether the admission or rejection of the new State would, under all the
circumstances, tend the more strongly to the restoration of the national
authority throughout the Union. That which helps most in this direction
is the most expedient at this time. Doubtless those in remaining Virginia
would return to the Union, so to speak, less reluctantly without the division
of the old State than with it; but I think we could not save as much
in this quarter by rejecting the new State, as we should lose by it in West
Virginia. We can scarcely dispense with the aid of West Virginia in
this struggle; much less can we afford to have her against us, in Congress
and in the field. Her brave and good men regard her admission
into the Union as a matter of life and death. They have been true to the
Union under very severe trials. We have so acted as to justify their
hopes, and we cannot fully retain their confidence and coöperation if we
seem to break faith with them. In fact, they could not do so much for us,
if they would. Again, the admission of the new State turns that much
slave soil, to free, and thus is a certain and irrevocable encroachment
upon the cause of the rebellion. The division of a State is dreaded as a
precedent. But a measure made expedient by a war is no precedent for
times of peace. It is said that the admission of West Virginia is secession,
and tolerated only because it is our secession. Well, if we call it by
that name, there is still difference enough between secession against the
Constitution and secession in favor of the Constitution. I believe the
admission of West Virginia into the Union is expedient.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c010'><sup>[197]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The bill passed by the House on the 10th was approved
by the President on the 31st of December, 1862; after naming
the forty-eight counties to constitute the new State the
act declares, among other things, that since the convention
framed the constitution for West Virginia its people had
expressed a wish to change section seven of the eleventh article
by inserting the following in its place, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i>: “The children of
slaves born within the limits of this State after the fourth day
of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, shall be free; and
that all slaves within the said State who shall, at the time
aforesaid, be under the age of ten years, shall be free when
they arrive at the age of twenty-one years; and all slaves over
ten and under twenty-one years, shall be free when they arrive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>at the age of twenty-five years; and no slave shall be permitted
to come into the State for permanent residence therein.”<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c010'><sup>[198]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The constitution thus amended was unanimously ratified by
the convention, which on a summons of the commissioners
reassembled February 18, 1863, and also by the people, to
whom it was submitted at an election held on May 26 following.<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c010'><sup>[199]</sup></a>
President Lincoln on April 20 issued a proclamation
declaring that the prescribed conditions having been complied
with, the constitution would go into force in sixty days
from that date; the formation of the new State was complete
and it became a member of the Union on the 20th of
June, 1863.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c010'><sup>[200]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Daniel Webster, in an address delivered thirteen years before,
at the laying of the corner-stone of an addition to the
Federal Capitol, had asked: “And ye men of Western Virginia,
... what benefit do you propose to yourself by
disunion? If you ‘secede,’ what do you ‘secede’ from, and
what do you ‘accede’ to? Do you look for the current of
the Ohio to change, and to bring you and your commerce to
the tide-waters of the eastern rivers? What man in his
senses can suppose that you would remain part and parcel of
Virginia a month after Virginia should have ceased to be
part and parcel of the Union?”<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c010'><sup>[201]</sup></a> The remarkable prediction
of the great orator was fulfilled; his inspired vision had
pierced the future. The Old Dominion had separated forever
along the line of the Alleghanies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before relating the subsequent history of the restored
government, it is proper to notice a few important events in
the early career of the new Commonwealth. On January
31, 1863, an act passed the General Assembly of Virginia
giving consent to the transfer of Berkeley County to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>State of West Virginia. The preamble of this act affirms
that its people desired to be annexed to the proposed State.
The question of transfer, however, was to be decided by a
majority of voters at an election to be held on the fourth
Thursday of May. If, however, the polls could not be safely
opened on that day, the Governor was empowered to postpone
the election by proclamation. The commissioners who
superintended the polling were to certify the results to the
Executive. On February 4 succeeding another act made it
lawful for voters in certain districts including twenty-three
counties to declare, at a general election to be held on the
fourth Thursday of May, whether these specified counties
should be annexed to West Virginia. The consent of the
Legislature of that State was, of course, made a condition of
the transfer, after which the jurisdiction of Virginia over such
counties was to cease.</p>

<p class='c000'>West Virginia statutes of August 5 and November 2, 1863,
in words, admit Berkeley and Jefferson counties, and they
have ever since been under her jurisdiction. When admitted
into the Union it was with a provision in her constitution
that she might acquire additional territory; therefore Congress
gave its consent in advance and it was not afterwards
withdrawn. In brief, West Virginia accepted the transfer
and it was authorized by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth
of Virginia.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c010'><sup>[202]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>State officers were elected on May 28, when the following
unconditional Union candidates, receiving a vote of about
30,000, were chosen without opposition: Arthur I. Boreman,
Governor; J. E. Boyers, Secretary of State; Campbell Tarr,
Treasurer; Samuel Crane, Auditor; A. B. Caldwell, Attorney-General;
also three judges of a court of appeals.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inauguration of the new State, which was marked by
imposing ceremonies, took place at Wheeling, the capital, on
June 20, 1863. Mr. Pierpont, the retiring executive of reorganized
Virginia, briefly addressed the assembled citizens
and urged them not to forsake the flag; he then introduced
his successor, whom he pronounced “true as steel.” Governor
Boreman in his short speech said that the only terms of
peace were that the rebels should lay down their arms and
submit to the regularly constituted authority of the United
States.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Legislature of West Virginia convened on the same
day. Waitman T. Willey and P. G. Van Winkle were elected
United States Senators.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c010'><sup>[203]</sup></a> In his first message Governor Boreman
recommended to the General Assembly the immediate
passage of laws effectually to extirpate slavery, and also the
enactment of a law that no man should be permitted to vote or
to hold office until he had taken the oath of allegiance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>In the Presidential election of 1864, the first held since the
adoption of the Constitution in which any State deliberately
neglected to appoint electors, 33,680 votes were polled in
West Virginia; of this number the Union ticket received 23,223
and the McClellan electors 10,457.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c010'><sup>[204]</sup></a> Elections had also
been held in Louisiana and Tennessee by authority of the
governments established there under Mr. Lincoln’s plan of reconstruction;
the Republican majority in Congress, however,
denied the validity of the organizations in the two States last
named and refused to count the votes which they presented.
This question will be fully considered when we come to trace
the development of the Congressional plan. At the regular
State election Governor Boreman was chosen without opposition,
receiving 19,098 votes. With the subsequent history of
the new Commonwealth the subject of reconstruction is not
much concerned.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the formation of an independent Commonwealth the
counties beyond the Alleghanies were withdrawn from the
jurisdiction of the restored government, which after the inaugural
ceremonies at Wheeling selected for its capital the city
of Alexandria, where it continued till May 25, 1865, to exercise
its functions in those parts of the Old Dominion within
the lines of the Union army. A State government was
promptly organized by the election of a legislature and of executive
officers. In this establishment the loyal eastern counties
participated. Mr. Pierpont was elected Governor for the term
of three years beginning January 1, 1864. A Lieutenant-Governor,
a Secretary of State, a Treasurer, an Auditor, an
Adjutant-General and an Attorney-General were also
chosen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Governor in his message to the Assembly mentioned
slavery as doomed, and recommended the calling of a convention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>so to amend the State constitution as to abolish the
institution forever. In compliance with this suggestion the
Legislature, on December 21, 1863, passed an act directing a
convention to be held at Alexandria on the 13th of February
succeeding to amend the constitution and prohibit slavery in
the counties of Accomac, Northampton, Princess Ann, Elizabeth
City and York (including the cities of Norfolk and
Portsmouth). These with Berkeley County had been excepted
from the operation of the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>

<p class='c000'>None but loyal citizens who had not assisted the
insurgents since January 1, 1863, were allowed to take part,
and those whose right to vote might be challenged were
required to swear support of the Constitution and to declare
that they had not in any way given aid or comfort to the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The convention, consisting of sixteen members, assembled
in the new capital at the appointed time and remained in
session till April 11 following, when a constitution was
adopted.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c010'><sup>[205]</sup></a> Various amendments, relating chiefly to the regulation
of the elective franchise and to the abolition of slavery,
were discussed and agreed upon. The work of this miniature
convention was ordered to be proclaimed without a submission
to the people. It was not, however, recognized by Congress,
though the civil government which authorized its formation
was permitted to continue under it, provisionally only, and in
all respects subject to the paramount authority of the United
States at any time to abolish, modify, or supersede.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the bill for the admission of West Virginia passed
both Houses, yet Congress was by no means unanimous in
giving its consent to that measure. In the debates, of which a
synopsis has been given, the hostility of Thaddeus Stevens
and other influential members is scarcely concealed. This
opposition to executive policy slowly gathered strength, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>by 1863 had become formidable enough to defeat the admission
of Representatives from the Alexandria government.
The Senators, however, remained, Lemuel J. Bowden till his
death, January 2, 1864, when his successor was refused admission,
and John S. Carlile till the expiration of his term in
1865.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the assembling of the 38th Congress, which commenced
its first session December 7, 1863, Joseph E. Segar, Lucius H.
Chandler and Benjamin M. Kitchen appeared as Representatives
from Virginia. On May 17 succeeding Mr. Dawes from
the Committee of Elections reported a resolution to the effect
that Joseph E. Segar, from the First District of Virginia, was
not entitled to a seat in that Congress. The case of Mr.
Chandler, regarded as precisely similar, was considered at
the same time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The district which Mr. Segar claimed to represent was composed
of twenty counties; of these, Chairman Dawes asserted,
only four participated in the election. Polling places were not
opened in any other part of the district, the Confederate authorities
being in possession of the remaining counties. As
there could be no free exercise of the franchise in this situation
Mr. Segar, it was contended, was not properly chosen,
and, therefore, was not entitled to a seat. The vote cast,
though not accurately ascertained, was estimated at 1,677, of
which the claimant received 1,300. Because of his loyalty and
the sacrifices he had made, the Committee regretted the
necessity of deciding against him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Segar, speaking in his own behalf, reminded the House
that in a preceding election, when he received 559 out of
1,018 votes polled in three counties, he was admitted after a
delay of seven or eight weeks; but when he was sent by a
larger constituency and came as the choice of four counties
he was informed that he had no right to a seat, and some of his
colleagues who favored his admission in 1862 voted to exclude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>him. The Committee’s report, he asserted, admitted the
existence of such a State as Virginia. He asked Chairman
Dawes a rather embarrassing question when he inquired
how a State could have two Senators and no Representative
in Congress. In conclusion he pronounced restored State
organization and gradual accretion to be the best method of
reconstruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Concerning the title of Mr. Chandler, from the Second Congressional
District, Chairman Dawes stated that of the 779
votes polled in the election 778 were cast for the claimant.
For the same reason as in the case of Mr. Segar only a small
part of that District was free to participate in the election,
and nearly all the votes were polled in the city of Norfolk.
The committee reported against his admission on the same
ground taken in Mr. Segar’s case.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chandler, who was permitted to state his case to the House,
cited a resolution introduced by his former school-mate, Owen
Lovejoy, the well-known abolitionist, authorizing the names
of the three Virginia claimants to be enrolled as Representatives.
That resolution, however, was tabled and their credentials
referred to the Committee of Elections.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1860 the Union vote in his District was only 6,712;
of that number 2,900, he said, were in Norfolk and Portsmouth;
the latter city had cast more votes against secession
than the remainder of his District. Great numbers of loyal
men, however, left there at the beginning of the war. Electors
being under no obligation to vote may allow an election to go
by default when one citizen could return a member to Congress.
Territorially restored Virginia was larger than Delaware
and possessed twice the area of Rhode Island.</p>

<p class='c000'>The case of Benjamin M. Kitchen, on which the Committee
had previously made an adverse report, differed from
those of the other two claimants in that he had received
nearly all of his vote in Berkeley County, which possessed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>sort of wandering character, for it was somewhat uncertain
whether it was under the jurisdiction of the new or
the old State. What action was taken on the Committee’s
report does not appear, but it may be inferred from a facetious
remark of one member who observed that, like Segar and
Chandler, Kitchen had been privileged to retire to private life.
The two former were refused admission by the decided vote
of 94 to 23.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides endeavoring to win back the wavering, Governor
Pierpont was occupied in taking measures for the relief of
the distressed. In the vicinity of Norfolk and Portsmouth
there was a large number of destitute persons whose natural
supporters were still following the declining fortunes of the
Confederacy or had been killed in its service. While it was
universally agreed that their necessities should be relieved,
the military and civil authorities were in conflict as to the
mode of providing for them. The President in his efforts to
establish amicable relations between the officers of the army
and those of the State invoked the assistance of the Governor.
As the restored Commonwealth could not be consistently
recognized while its capital was in a state of blockade the
President by proclamation, September 24, 1863, declared that
the interdiction of trade with the port of Alexandria had
ceased.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Butler with headquarters at Fortress Monroe took
command of the Department of Virginia and North Carolina
November 2, 1863. His predecessors, he asserted, had endeavored
to recruit a regiment of Virginians; but after several
months of energetic trial their efforts were abandoned. As
eastern Virginia claimed to be a loyal and fully organized
State, Butler renewed the attempt, whereupon Governor Pierpont
protested vigorously. One and a half companies were all
the recruits that the Commonwealth would furnish, and these,
Butler asserts, were employed to defend lighthouses and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>protect Union inhabitants from outrages at the hands of their
disloyal neighbors.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c010'><sup>[206]</sup></a> This experience, it may be supposed, did
not tend to raise the Alexandria government in the esteem of
the Department Commander. We find accordingly that differences
soon sprang up between the civil and military authorities.
An attempt to regulate the liquor traffic in Norfolk and vicinity
was the occasion of an open rupture. Civil officers
continued to collect the payments imposed by law on those
engaged in the business; the military power, to keep the traffic
under better control, undertook to give to a few firms a
monopoly of the importation. In this situation many small
retailers refused to pay their licenses and were indicted in
the local courts. To foil this purpose, General Shepley issued,
June 22, 1864, an order providing that “on the day of the
ensuing municipal election in the city of Norfolk a poll will
be opened at the several places of voting, and separate ballot-boxes
will be kept open during the hours of voting, in which
voters may deposit their ballots, ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ upon the following
question: Those in favor of continuing the present
form of municipal government during the existence of military
occupation will vote ‘yes.’ Those opposed to it will
vote ‘no.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>Governor Pierpont resented this action and promptly issued
a proclamation protesting against it as a revolutionary proceeding
in violation of the Federal Constitution, adding, “No
loyal citizen, therefore, is expected to vote on the proposed
question.” In a vigorous pamphlet discussing the “abuses of
military power” he repeated his criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>Butler at this point took up the cudgels for his subordinate
and in a general order, dated June 30, 1864, discussed the incident
at some length. Pierpont was alluded to as “a person
who calls himself Governor,” and as one “pretending to be the
head of the restored government of Virginia, which government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>is unrecognized by the Congress, laws, and Constitution
of the United States.” The order further recited that as the
loyal citizens of Norfolk had voted against the further trial of
the experiment of municipal government “therefore it is ordered
that all attempts to exercise civil office and power,
under any supposed city election, within the city of Norfolk
and its environs, must cease, and the persons pretending
to be elected to civil offices at the late election, and those heretofore
elected to municipal offices since the rebellion, must
no longer attempt to exercise such functions; and upon any
pretense or attempt so to do, the military commandant at
Norfolk will see to it that persons so acting are stayed and
quieted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A memorial to Mr. Lincoln enlisted his sympathy and
secured for Pierpont the assistance of Attorney-General Bates,
who on July 11 wrote the President a long official letter
setting forth his sense of the serious military encroachment by
General Butler upon civil law and the authority of Mr. Pierpont
as Governor of Virginia. The Department Commander
replied in a communication of forty pages in sharp criticism
of the Alexandria government, which he characterized as a
“useless, expensive, and inefficient thing, unrecognized by
Congress, unknown to the Constitution of the United States,
and of such character that there is no command in the
Decalogue against worshiping it, being the likeness of nothing
in the heavens above, the earth beneath, or the waters under
the earth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Attorney-General, who was accused of a design to
create a conflict between the civil and the military power, also
came in for a share of rather violent criticism. In this altercation
each party accused the other of being assisted by only
secessionists and traitors.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c010'><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It was relative to this controversy that Mr. Lincoln, December
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>21, 1864, addressed to General Butler the following
communication:</p>

<p class='c013'>On the 9th of August last, I began to write you a letter, the enclosed
being a copy of so much as I then wrote. So far as it goes it embraces
the views I then entertained and still entertain.</p>

<p class='c013'>A little relaxation of the complaints made to me on the subject, occurring
about that time, the letter was not finished and sent. I now learn,
correctly I suppose, that you have ordered an election, similar to the one
mentioned, to take place on the eastern shore of Virginia. Let this be
suspended at least until conference with me and obtaining my approval.</p>

<p class='c013'>Your paper of the —— about Norfolk matters, is received, as also was
your other, on the same general subject, dated, I believe, some time in
February last. This subject has caused considerable trouble, forcing me
to give a good deal of time and reflection to it. I regret that crimination
and recrimination are mingled in it. I surely need not to assure you that
I have no doubt of your loyalty and devoted patriotism; and I must tell
you that I have no less confidence in those of Governor Pierpont and the
Attorney-General. The former—at first as the loyal governor of all Virginia,
including that which is now West Virginia, in organizing and furnishing
troops, and in all other proper matters—was as earnest, honest,
and efficient to the extent of his means as any other loyal governor.</p>

<p class='c013'>The inauguration of West Virginia as a new State left to him, as he
assumed, the remainder of the old State; and the insignificance of the
parts which are outside of the rebel lines, and consequently within his
reach, certainly gives a somewhat farcical air to his dominion, and I suppose
he, as well as I, has considered that it can be useful for little else
than as a nucleus to add to. The Attorney-General needs only to be
known to be relieved from all question as to loyalty and thorough devotion
to the national cause, constantly restraining as he does my tendency
to clemency for rebels and rebel sympathizers. But he is the law-officer
of the Government, and a believer in the virtue of adhering to law.</p>

<p class='c013'>Coming to the question itself, the military occupancy of Norfolk is a necessity
with us. If you, as department commander, find the cleansing of
the city necessary to prevent pestilence in your army; street-lights and a
fire department necessary to prevent assassinations and incendiarism
among your men and stores; wharfage necessary to land and ship men
and supplies; a large pauperism, badly conducted at a needlessly large
expense to the government; and find that all these things, or any of them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>are not reasonably well attended to by the civil government, you rightfully
may and must take them into your own hands. But you should do so on
your own avowed judgment of a military necessity, and not seem to admit
that there is no such necessity by taking a vote of the people on the
question.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nothing justifies the suspending of the civil by the military authority
but military necessity; and of the existence of that necessity, the military
commander, and not a popular vote, is to decide. And whatever is not
within such necessity should be left undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c013'>In your paper of February you fairly notified me that you contemplated
taking a popular vote, and, if fault there be, it was my fault that I did not
object then, which I probably should have done had I studied the subject
as closely as I have since done. I now think you would better place
whatever you feel is necessary to be done on this distinct ground of military
necessity, openly discarding all reliance for what you do on any election.
I also think you should so keep accounts as to show every item of
money received and how expended.</p>

<p class='c013'>The course here indicated does not touch the case when the military
commander, finding no friendly civil government existing, may, under
sanction or direction of the President, give assistance to the people to
inaugurate one.<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c010'><sup>[208]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On the same general subject the President one week later
wrote General Butler this brief note:</p>

<p class='c013'>I think you will find that the provost-marshal on the eastern shore
has, as by your authority, issued an order, not for a meeting, but
for an election. The order, printed in due form, was shown to me,
but as I did not retain it, I cannot give you a copy. If the people, on
their own motion, wish to hold a peaceful meeting, I suppose you
need not hinder them.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c010'><sup>[209]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It has elsewhere been observed that a Legislature representing
what remained of the restored government was chosen
at the time of Mr. Pierpont’s election. This body, however,
was but the merest shadow of the Assembly of that once
proud Commonwealth. Seven Delegates responded to the
roll call when the House convened in December, 1863. They
adjourned from day to day and on the 9th of that month organized
with eight members in the popular branch. Precisely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>how many Senators composed the upper House does not appear
in any notice of their proceedings accessible to the writer; the
aggregate number in both chambers, however, is said not to
have exceeded 16.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c010'><sup>[210]</sup></a> This estimate is probably correct; for in
the election, February 4, 1864, of a Secretary of State and a
Treasurer the total vote on joint ballot was only 14.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c010'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is probable that neither Mr. Lincoln nor Governor Pierpont
regarded this organization as anything more than a
nucleus around which the loyal elements might rally. Both
Congress and the military authorities, however, treated it
with scant courtesy. It is not matter of surprise, therefore,
that memorials were presented to the United States Senate
petitioning for the substitution of a military for this feeble
civil government. To offset this movement remonstrances
from citizens of Alexandria and from citizens of Loudoun
County were offered, January 17, 1865, by Senator Willey,
of West Virginia. All the memorials of both classes were
referred to the Committee on Territories.</p>

<p class='c000'>By Mr. Willey credentials of Hon. Joseph Segar, Senator-elect
from Virginia, were presented, February 17, 1865, to
supply the vacancy caused by the death of Lemuel J. Bowden.
Mr. Willey moved that the credentials be read and placed on
the files, and that the oath of office be administered to Mr.
Segar. The credentials were read and immediately after
Mr. Sumner moved that the papers be referred to the Committee
on the Judiciary. Senator Willey opposed the reference.
The credentials, he believed, were proper on their face;
they came to the Senate in due form under the seal of the
State of Virginia. Mr. Segar was the accredited successor
of Mr. Bowden, who died while a member of Congress. If
Mr. Bowden was entitled to a seat his successor was likewise
entitled if his credentials were regular and correct.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Mr. Cowan also opposed the reference because he did not
think it wise to abandon the policy hitherto pursued in dealing
with loyal minorities in the rebellious States. He would
be sorry, he said, if these States were repulsed when they were
desirous to do all they could to achieve the very end for which
the present tremendous struggle was taking place. When Mr.
Bowden came to take his seat no such objection was made.
A question by Senator Hale developed the fact, however,
that Mr. Bowden presented himself before the vote was taken
on the admission of West Virginia.</p>

<p class='c000'>Trumbull believed that a reference of the credentials, just as
in the Arkansas case, would bring up the question. Senator
Howard, who favored a reference, thought that the entire
question of the right of Virginia to be represented in Congress
should be gone into. He would thank the committee for a
concise account of all the proceedings connected with the
election of Mr. Segar and his colleague. He asked whether
a State like Virginia, in armed rebellion, could have Senators
on that floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Saulsbury pointed out the change that had come over
the judgment of the Senate. When Messrs. Willey and
Carlile appeared there was, he said, but a corporal’s guard who
opposed their right to seats, because Virginia was in rebellion,
and it was then held by the minority that Senators should represent
the sovereignty of their States. Those who were
then most zealous for the admission of the gentlemen claiming
to represent Virginia had become most vehement in their
opposition to the admission of Mr. Segar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Senator McDougall believed that to refer the proposition to
the committee would be to bury it, and no resurrection, he
said, had been proclaimed for any such thing. He had his
impressions and was as well prepared to discuss the question
then as at any time. Virginia, according to his understanding
of the philosophy of the Constitution, was a State of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Union. He believed the Senator-elect, by reason of his credentials,
could take the oath, though that was not conclusive
of his right to a seat in the Senate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Henry Wilson, of Massachusetts, believed that Congress
because of its action for three years was bound to recognize
the existence of both the Governor and Legislature of Virginia.
He was disposed, however, to support the motion of his
colleague, Charles Sumner, as well as the amendment thereto
which authorized the committee to inquire into the election,
returns and qualifications in the case of the claimant. Certain
parts of Virginia, exempted by the President’s proclamation,
were not in rebellion. Every square mile additional
over which Federal authority was restored came by the terms
of that proclamation into the same condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Willey asserted that the Legislature sneeringly referred
to as “the Common Council of Alexandria” represented
216,000 loyal people. He believed that county after county,
as fast as they were relieved from the power of the rebellion,
would come to the support of the loyal nucleus at Alexandria.
It would place the Senate, he said, in a singular position to
repulse the claimant while his State was represented by
another Senator [Carlile].</p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Sherman stated that Mr. Segar’s credentials purported
to show that he had been elected a member of the Senate
on the 8th of December and that they bore date of December
12, 1864. Therefore he had slept for sixty or seventy days
on his right to a seat which would, at any rate, expire on
the 4th of March. The succeeding Congress, he said, would
have ample time to decide the question, for, no doubt, at that
time a gentleman claiming to be a Senator from Virginia
would present himself. Then it could be deliberately determined.
His motion to lay the credentials on the table
prevailed by a vote of 29 to 13.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c010'><sup>[212]</sup></a> When this action was taken
Carlile was among the eight absentees.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Pursuant to a proclamation of the President the Senate
assembled at noon of March 4 in executive session. Five
days later the question of admitting Senators from Virginia
came again before the Senate on presentation by Mr. Doolittle
of the credentials of Hon. John C. Underwood as Senator-elect
from that State for six years from the 4th of March.
His credentials were read and after some discussion it was
agreed to postpone their consideration as well as those of Mr.
Segar until the following session. Henderson and Doolittle
spoke in favor of the early recognition by Congress of the
local governments in those States which had been brought
partly under Federal power. The account of Virginian affairs
will be resumed in the final chapter.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>V<br /> <span class='large'>ANTI-SLAVERY LEGISLATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The efforts of Union minorities in Tennessee, in
Louisiana and in Arkansas to establish governments
in harmony with the Constitution and laws of the
United States, and the agency of President Lincoln in effecting
that result, have been somewhat particularly described in
the preceding pages. The principal events which marked the
progress of secession in those States, the military successes
which brought Federal authorities to consider the restoration
of loyal governments within their borders, and the operation
of those causes which ultimately overthrew rebellion have been
more rapidly sketched. To trace the successive steps which
led to the emancipation of slaves in the seceding States a
somewhat more ample narrative will be required. This subject
is not only of intrinsic interest but its culmination in the
proclamation of September 22, 1862, marks the introduction
into the President’s plan of restoration of an element hitherto
left out of account.</p>

<p class='c000'>In December, 1859, when John Brown, for his rash though
courageous attempt to liberate slaves, was hanged by the
authorities of Virginia a great majority of even Northern
people looked on with indifference or with approval. The
inhabitants of the free States, however, were rather law-abiding
than pitiless and came in time to revere the memory
of that stern old Puritan. Ideas in those times matured with
amazing rapidity, and fourteen months had scarcely elapsed
when James B. McKean, a Representative from New York,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>introduced into Congress, three days before the Confederate
government was organized, the following resolution:</p>

<p class='c013'>Whereas the “Gulf States” have assumed to secede from the Union,
and it is deemed important to prevent the “border slave States” from
following their example; and whereas it is believed that those who are
inflexibly opposed to any measure of compromise or concession that involves,
or may involve, a sacrifice of principle or the extension of slavery,
would nevertheless cheerfully concur in any lawful measure for the emancipation
of slaves: Therefore,</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Resolved</em>, That the select committee of five be instructed to inquire
whether, by the consent of the people, or of the State governments, or by
compensating the slaveholders, it be practicable for the General Government
to procure the emancipation of the slaves in some, or all, of the
“border States”; and if so, to report a bill for that purpose.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c010'><sup>[213]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Burnett, of Kentucky, desiring to discuss the proposition,
it was laid on the table and received no further consideration.
Whether Mr. Lincoln had much reflected upon the
principle of this resolution or the reasoning in its preamble,
he had not become on March 4 a convert to its essential idea,
for in his inaugural address he was content, in expressing his
sentiments on the institution of slavery, to re-affirm a declaration
which he had formerly made. “I have no purpose,”
said he, “directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution
of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have
no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.”<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c010'><sup>[214]</sup></a>
Even if the occasion had not demanded the language of conciliation
we might easily credit this solemn assurance. Indeed,
for an entire year after this announcement he refrained
in his public utterances from taking any attitude hostile to the
continuance of slavery. The influences which forced him to
adopt other opinions may be briefly related.</p>

<p class='c000'>On May 22, 1861, General Butler arrived at Fortress
Monroe and at once took command of the Department of Virginia;
next day he sent a reconnoitering party to Hampton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>and in the terror and confusion occasioned by the presence
of Yankee soldiers three slaves of Colonel Mallory, a
Confederate officer, effected their escape; during the afternoon
they remained in concealment and at night reached the Union
pickets. The following morning they were brought before
the Federal commander, whom they informed of their master’s
purpose to employ them in military operations in North Carolina.
On the next day Major John B. Cary, also of the Confederate
army, and a former delegate with Butler in the
Baltimore Convention, came to the fort with a flag of truce,
and as a representative of Colonel Mallory demanded the
surrender of these runaways pursuant to the provisions of the
Federal Constitution under which the Union commander
claimed to act. With characteristic readiness came the reply
that the Fugitive Slave Law could not be invoked in this
case; Virginia assumed to be a foreign State and she must
count it among the disadvantages of her position if, so far at
least, she was taken at her word. These negroes further
informed General Butler or his officers that if they were not
returned others would come next day. On the 26th eight
slaves were before him awaiting an audience; one squad of
forty-seven came early on the 27th and another lot of a dozen
arrived during the same day. Then they came by twenties,
thirties and forties both to Fortress Monroe and Newport
News.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c010'><sup>[215]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Thus arose an important question on which the Government
had yet developed no policy. As the acts for the rendition of
fugitive slaves were not repealed till June, 1864, the views of
individual commanders temporarily prevailed. Without precedent
or instructions General McDowell by an order entirely
excluded them from his lines. Caprice, too, entered into a
settlement of the problem, and even a whimsical solution
was sometimes attempted. A felicitous invention for determining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>these controversies between master and bondman is
ascribed to the colonel of a Massachusetts regiment. Both
the claimant and the claimed were put outside his tent for a
trial of speed; the negro, proving the fleeter, was never heard
of again.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c010'><sup>[216]</sup></a> An institution which had practically determined
both the foreign and domestic policy of the United States
for an entire generation was suddenly become the sport of a
subordinate officer of volunteers! The wise should have
heeded these signs.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the Federal commander in Virginia was exchanging
arguments with Confederate officers, General McClellan at his
headquarters in Cincinnati was considering a proclamation
which on May 26 he issued to the Union men of western
Virginia. This document, among other things, says: “All
your rights shall be religiously respected, notwithstanding
all that has been said by the traitors to induce you to believe
our advent among you will be signalized by an interference
with your slaves. Understand one thing clearly: not only will
we abstain from all such interference, but we will, on the contrary,
<em>with an iron hand crush any attempt at insurrection on
their part</em>.”<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c010'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Scarcely less explicit in its announcement concerning
slavery was General Patterson’s proclamation of June 3, 1861,
to troops of the Department of Pennsylvania. “You must
bear in mind,” says its concluding paragraph, that “you are
going for the good of the whole country, and that, while it is
your duty to punish sedition, you must protect the loyal,
<em>and, should the occasion offer, at once suppress servile
insurrection</em>.”<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c010'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Butler’s interview with Major Cary had been promptly
communicated to the War Department, whose chief, Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Cameron, expressed in his reply of May 30 approval of the
General’s action. The Secretary, however, endeavored to distinguish
between interference with slave property and the
surrender of negroes that came voluntarily within Federal
lines. The commander was further directed to “employ such
persons in the services to which they may be best adapted,
keeping an account of the labor by them performed, of the
value of it, and the expenses of their maintenance,”<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c010'><sup>[219]</sup></a> the question
of their final disposition to be reserved for future
determination.</p>

<p class='c000'>In defence of his attitude toward masters of fugitives who
had been employed in the batteries or on the fortifications of
the enemy, international law supplied General Butler with an
analogy that he skillfully applied to the novel conditions
which had arisen. Articles of assistance in military operations
cannot in time of war be imported by neutrals into an
enemy’s country, and the attempt to introduce such goods
renders them liable to seizure as lawful prize. It did not
greatly embarrass this versatile lawyer that the term <em>contraband</em>
applies exclusively to relations between a belligerent and
a neutral, or that the decision of a prize court might be necessary
to determine whether a particular article had been so designated.
No doubt he believed firmly in the doctrine that the
wants of war are contraband of war. In his correspondence
with General Scott he had observed that “as a military question,
it would seem to be a measure of necessity” to deprive
disloyal masters of the services of their slaves, and this, on the
pretext that they were contraband of war, he proceeded to do
by refusing to surrender any negroes coming inside his lines.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c010'><sup>[220]</sup></a>
This method of settling the difficulty was what Secretary
Cameron had approved. But this phase presented the question
in its extreme simplicity. A refusal to return the slaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>of Confederate officers or of Confederate sympathizers was
one thing; similar treatment of loyal slaveholders would not
be so readily overlooked by authority. Though such cases
were more likely to occur in Maryland, Kentucky or Missouri,
that fact did not prevent the subject from assuming very great
importance even in Virginia. Whole families escaped from
their masters, and General Butler soon had on his hands
negroes from three months to almost fourscore years of age.</p>

<p class='c000'>Attorney-General Bates, writing July 23, 1861, to United
States Marshal J. L. McDowell, of Kansas, who had asked
whether he should give his official service in executing the
fugitive slave law, said in response to the inquiry:</p>

<p class='c013'>It is the President’s constitutional duty to “take care that the laws be
faithfully executed.” That means all the laws. He has no right to discriminate,
no right to execute the laws he likes, and leave unexecuted
those he dislikes. And of course you and I, his subordinates, can have
no wider latitude of discretion than he has. Missouri is a State in the
Union. The insurrectionary disorders in Missouri are but individual
crimes, and do not change the legal status of the State, nor change its
rights and obligations as a member of the Union.</p>

<p class='c013'>A refusal by a ministerial officer to execute any law which properly
belongs to his office, is an official misdemeanor, of which I have no doubt
the President would take notice.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c010'><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Attorney-General in this instance merely amplified a
suggestion contained in the inaugural.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward the close of July, 1861, the number of “contrabands”
had increased to nine hundred, and the Union commander
again requested instructions.<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c010'><sup>[222]</sup></a> Secretary Cameron’s
reply on the 8th of August following merely authorized, what
General Butler had all along been doing, employing them at
such labor as they were adapted to and keeping a complete
record, so that when peace was restored the essential facts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>of each case could easily be ascertained.<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c010'><sup>[223]</sup></a> His tact in dealing
with this question appears from an act of Congress approved
August 6 in which his extension of meaning to the word
<em>contraband</em> is adopted. This declared that if persons held
to labor or service were employed in hostility to the United
States, the right to their services should be forfeited and such
persons be discharged therefrom.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c010'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Exclusion of fugitive slaves from the quarters and camps
of troops serving in the Department of Washington was provided
by a general order of July 17, 1861, and a few weeks
later, August 10, the departure by railway of negroes from
the District of Columbia was prevented unless evidence of
freedom could be adduced.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c010'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Far more important, however, than these prudent regulations
of the Adjutant-General was the celebrated proclamation
of Fremont, dated St. Louis, August 31, 1861, which declared
martial law throughout the entire State of Missouri and expressed
a purpose both to confiscate the property and free the
negroes of all persons in the State who should take up arms
against the United States or who were shown to have taken
an active part with their enemy in the field.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c010'><sup>[226]</sup></a> The President,
in a communication of September 2 following, wrote General
Fremont expressing anxiety concerning the effects of this
proclamation: “I think there is great danger,” said Mr.
Lincoln, “that the closing paragraph, in relation to the confiscation
of property and the liberating slaves of traitorous owners,
will alarm our Southern Union friends and turn them
against us; perhaps ruin our rather fair prospect for
Kentucky.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c010'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Though General Fremont had acted wholly on his own
responsibility he refused so to modify that portion of his proclamation
relative to emancipating slaves as to conform to the
act of Congress referred to, and in a letter requested the President
“openly to direct” him “to make the correction.” Referring
to this part of his communication Mr. Lincoln replied
on the 11th: “Your answer, just received, expresses the
preference on your part that I should make an open order for
the modification, which I very cheerfully do. It is therefore
ordered that the said clause of said proclamation be so modified,
held, and construed, as to conform to, and not to transcend,
the provisions on the same subject contained in the act
of Congress” approved August 6, 1861.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c010'><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As late as October 14 the War Department was guided by
the principles developed in its correspondence with Butler, the
instructions of that date to General T. W. Sherman being
based upon this policy.<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c010'><sup>[230]</sup></a> A month later inhabitants of the
eastern shore of Virginia were informed by General Dix
that “special directions have been given not to interfere with
the condition of any person held to domestic service;” to
prevent any such occurrence slaves were not permitted to come
within his lines.<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c010'><sup>[231]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Besides those who favored military emancipation, a large
class seriously expected that the war would not only preserve
the integrity of the Union, but in some way result in a general
liberation of slaves. This feeling, manifested in various ways,
was rapidly gathering strength, and as early as November 8
found enthusiastic expression at a public meeting of two thousand
citizens held in Cooper Institute, New York city. This
assembly, which convened at the suggestion of Mr. Lincoln,
was presided over by Hon. George Bancroft and attended by
many distinguished persons of both the nation and the State.
Besides the remarks of its illustrious chairman addresses were
made by William Cullen Bryant, General Ambrose Burnside,
Professor Francis Lieber and others. Shortly before the
speakers arrived a gentleman arose in the audience, and in a
ringing voice proposed “Three cheers for John C. Fremont!”
These were given, says a newspaper account, “with electrical
effect and without a murmur of dissent.” The meeting was
evidently not in entire sympathy with the President’s order
modifying that General’s proclamation of the preceding
August.</p>

<p class='c000'>North Carolina, as is well known, was not so ardent for
secession as most of her sister States in the South; forced to
take sides, however, she imitated the example of her neighbors.
Even then all her people did not share the opinions of their
leaders, and when Federal troops landed in the vicinity of
Hatteras nearly four thousand loyal inhabitants of the coast
flocked to their lines and readily took the oath of allegiance
to the United States; for this conduct they incurred the extreme
hatred of secessionists, who soon reduced them to a
condition of distress. To relieve their destitution, by supplies
of food and clothing, the meeting was called in Cooper Institute.
Resolutions of sympathy were unanimously adopted; a
committee of relief was appointed to collect from the city and
elsewhere such funds as were necessary for the purchase of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>supplies, which were to be forwarded and distributed in the
most judicious manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If the President,” said Mr. Bancroft, “has any doubt
under the terrible conflict into which he has been brought,
let him hear the words of one of his predecessors. Alien nullification
raised itself in South Carolina. Andrew Jackson, in
the watches of the night, as he sat alone finishing that proclamation,
sent the last words of it to Livingston, his bosom
friend and best adviser. He sent it with these words; I have
had the letter in my own hands, handed to me by the only
surviving child of Mr. Livingston. I know the letter which I
now read is a copy: ‘I submit the above as the conclusion
of the proclamation for your amendment and revision. Let it
receive your best flight of eloquence to strike to the heart and
speak to the feelings of my deluded countrymen of South
Carolina. The Union must be preserved without blood if
this be possible; but it must be preserved at all hazards and
at any price.’” Mr. Bancroft added: “We send the army
into the South to maintain the Union, to restore the validity
of the Constitution. If any one presents claims under the
Constitution, let him begin by placing the Constitution in
power, by respecting it and upholding it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Francis Lieber referred to slavery as “that great anachronism,
out of time, out of place in the nineteenth century,” and
Rev. Doctor Tyng said, “if slavery is in the way of the
Union, then tread slavery down into the dust.”<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c010'><sup>[232]</sup></a> These sentiments
were received with applause.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Bancroft a week later wrote to the President:</p>

<p class='c013'>Following out your suggestion, a very numerous meeting of New-Yorkers
assembled last week to take measures for relieving the loyal
sufferers of Hatteras. I take the liberty to enclose you some remarks
which I made on the occasion. You will find in them a copy of an unpublished
letter of one of your most honored predecessors, with which
you cannot fail to be pleased.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Your administration has fallen upon times which will be remembered
as long as human events find a record. I sincerely wish to you the glory
of perfect success. Civil War is the instrument of Divine Providence to
root out social slavery. Posterity will not be satisfied with the result unless
the consequences of the war shall effect an increase of free States.
This is the universal expectation and hope of men of all parties.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c010'><sup>[233]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On the 18th Mr. Lincoln sent this reply:</p>

<p class='c013'>I esteem it a high honor to have received a note from Mr. Bancroft
inclosing the report of proceedings of a New York meeting taking measures
for the relief of Union people of North Carolina. I thank you and
all others participating for this benevolent and patriotic movement.</p>

<p class='c013'>The main thought in the closing paragraph of your letter is one which
does not escape my attention, and with which I must deal in all due
caution, and with the best judgment I can bring to it.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c010'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>We have here the key to President Lincoln’s treatment of
the slavery question down to the hour of his lamented death.
As the hostile employment of negroes constituted by act of
August 6 a full answer to any claim for service General
McClellan was informed by Secretary Seward, December 4,
1861, that the arrest of such persons as fugitives from labor
“should be immediately followed by the military arrest of
the parties making the seizure.” These instructions were
called forth by intelligence that Virginia slaves engaged in hostility
to the United States frequently escaped from the enemy
and took refuge within the lines of the Army of the Potomac.
Coming afterward into the District of Columbia, such persons
upon the presumption arising from color, were liable to be
arrested by the Washington police.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c010'><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On December 3, 1861, in his first annual message to Congress,
Mr. Lincoln discussed without especial emphasis the
question of aiding those slaves who had been freed under the
act of August 6; he observed that this class was dependent
upon the United States; it was believed that, for their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>benefit, many of the States would enact similar laws; he therefore
recommended Congress to provide for accepting such
persons from the States,</p>

<p class='c013'>according to some mode of valuation, in lieu, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tanto</span></i>, of direct taxes,
or upon some other plan to be agreed on with such States respectively;
that such persons, on such acceptance by the General Government, be at
once deemed free; and that, in any event, steps be taken for colonizing
both classes (or the one first mentioned, if the other shall not be brought
into existence) at some place or places in a climate congenial to them.
It might be well to consider, too, whether the free colored people already
in the United States could not, so far as individuals may desire, be included
in such colonization.</p>

<p class='c013'>To carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory,
and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be expended in
the territorial acquisition. Having practiced the acquisition of territory
for nearly sixty years, the question of constitutional power to do so is
no longer an open one with us. The power was questioned at first by
Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in the purchase of Louisiana, yielded his
scruples on the plea of great expediency. If it be said that the only legitimate
object of acquiring territory is to furnish homes for white men, this
measure effects that object; for the emigration of colored men leaves
additional room for white men remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson,
however, placed the importance of procuring Louisiana more on political
and commercial grounds than on providing room for population.</p>

<p class='c013'>On this whole proposition, including the appropriation of money with
the acquisition of territory, does not the expediency amount to absolute
necessity—that without which the Government itself cannot be perpetuated?</p>

<p class='c013'>The war continues. In considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing
the insurrection, I have been anxious and careful that the inevitable
conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and
remorseless revolutionary struggle. I have, therefore, in every case
thought it proper to keep the integrity of the Union prominent as the primary
object of the contest on our part, leaving all questions which are not
of vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the Legislature.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade of
the ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force, by proclamation,
the law of Congress enacted at the last session for closing those
ports.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, also, obeying the dictates of prudence as well as the obligations of
law, instead of transcending I have adhered to the act of Congress to
confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes. If a new law upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>the same subject shall be proposed, its propriety will be duly considered.
The Union must be preserved; and hence all indispensable means must be
employed. We should not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme
measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are indispensable.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c010'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The President’s mastery of national affairs is seen in the
ability and thoroughness with which he treated a great variety
of important public questions; though his message touches
with the utmost delicacy the paramount issue of slavery it
really marked an advance in his position. However, he was
not yet abreast of the aggressive anti-slavery party in the 37th
Congress, which had just commenced its first regular session.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “increase of free States,” which Mr. Bancroft hoped
would result from the war, and which President Lincoln’s
reply shows had not escaped his attention, was not to be
effected by military emancipation in the field but by the voluntary
action of the States themselves. The caution and judgment
which he brought to bear on this subject are apparent
from even a casual examination of the message, which refers
to the number of slaves that had been freed by the incidents
of war, and to the extreme probability that still others would
be liberated in its progress. It contained also a recommendation
of colonization, a topic which had long been familiar
to Americans both North and South. To any new law emancipating
slaves for the participation of their masters in rebellion,
he promised to give due consideration. This part of the
message had the additional merit of being easily expanded
into a more definite policy. It was this characteristic prudence
that led the President to suppress the following remarks in a
report which the Secretary of War had prepared for the opening
of Congress in December, 1861:</p>

<p class='c013'>If it shall be found that the men who have been held by the rebels as
slaves are capable of bearing arms and performing efficient military service,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>it is the right, and may become the duty, of this government to arm
and equip them, and employ their services against the rebels, under proper
military regulation, discipline, and command.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c010'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Any legislation, or even any extended debate, on these
recommendations was prevented by questions deemed more
urgent by Congress. Indeed, the President does not appear
to have seriously expected favorable action at this time upon
his suggestions, for he resumed certain efforts which he had
been carefully considering. He believed that by the pressure
of war necessities the border States might be induced to take
up the idea of voluntary emancipation if the General Government
would pay their citizens the full property value of the
slaves they were asked to liberate; and this experiment seemed
most feasible in the small State of Delaware, which retained
only the merest fragment of a property interest in the
institution.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even before the appearance of his message a plan of compensated
abolishment had taken definite form in the mind
of the President, for about November 26 he had prepared
a draft of a bill for gradual emancipation in Delaware.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c010'><sup>[238]</sup></a>
Through Congressman George P. Fisher the proposition was
laid before the General Assembly of that State and received
favorable consideration in the lower House. By the Senate,
which convened November 25, 1861, it was taken up for discussion
on February 7 succeeding. Upon the question, 4
voted in favor and 4 against concurring in the action of the
more popular branch of the Legislature. The remaining
Senator, McFerran, was absent or silent and is not accounted
for in the journal of this special session. Therefore the
measure was returned non-concurred in to the other chamber.
The following preamble and joint resolution relative to the
proposed emancipation bill are self-explanatory. The Federal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>suggestion was repelled as an unwarranted interference
in the domestic concerns of that State:</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Whereas</em>, There has been circulating among the members of this General
Assembly a printed draft for a law to be entitled “An act for the
gradual emancipation of slaves in the State of Delaware with just compensation
to their owners”; <em>and whereas</em> many of the members of this
General Assembly have been requested to support it, the said draft being
in the following words: [Then follows the title, together with the
twenty-one sections composing the bill. To which is added:] <em>And
whereas</em> it is uncertain that said proposition will be submitted to this
General Assembly for its action, nevertheless, viewing it to be unworthy
of their support, they desire to place upon record the grounds of their
condemnation; therefore</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of
Delaware in General Assembly met</em>, That the members of this Legislature
were not elected with a view to the passage of any act for the emancipation
of slaves, but with the understanding, either expressed or implied,
that legislation upon the distracting subject of slavery was hostile to the
public peace, and therefore to be avoided; that the passage of the act
drafted as aforesaid, inasmuch as it renders Congressional action necessary,
would, upon the apparent application of the State of Delaware, introduce
the slavery question into Congress, would encourage the abolition
element therein, and fortify it in its purpose to destroy entirely all property
in slaves, and furthermore, would be injurious to the quiet and harmony
that prevail in this State.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Be it further resolved by the authority aforesaid</em>, That it is the opinion
of this General Assembly, that Congress has no right to appropriate a
dollar for the purchase of slaves, and that such a proposal, coming from
the source to which it is traceable, evinces a design on the part of those
having control of our national affairs to abolish slavery in the States.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Resolved further</em>, That this General Assembly having in mind the interests
of the people of Delaware, are not willing, especially at a time of
financial embarrassment, to make the State of Delaware a guarantor of
any debt the payment of which depends upon the mere pledge of public
faith; that the confidence of the people of this State that nothing would
ever be done to promote a disunion of our National system, but that it
would remain, as expressed by Webster “one and inseparable, now and
forever,” having been impaired by the events of the last two years, we are
and should be very cautious in resting our obligations on the mere faith of
others; that by accepting the terms to be offered by the United States,
we should, upon grounds of the plainest equity, be held to have pledged
the faith of Delaware for the payment of nine hundred thousand dollars
as mentioned in the draft aforesaid; that, keeping in mind the fact that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>the power of the nation is now put forth to suppress a rebellion prevailing
throughout a very large portion of its territory, and that in consequence
of such rebellion and the uncertainty of its being speedily quelled,
the stocks of the United States, which heretofore brought in the market a
sum far beyond the par value thereof, are now selling at a continually increasing
rate of discount, we are unwilling to pledge the faith of Delaware
(a faith which has never been violated) that the proposed mode of
payment is safe and proper.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Resolved further</em>, That when the people of Delaware desire to abolish
slavery within her borders, they will do so in their own way, having due
regard to strict equity; that any interference from without, and all suggestions
of saving expense to the people, or others of like character, are
improper to be made to an honorable people, such as we represent, and
are hereby repelled—that though the State of Delaware is small, and her
people not of the richest, they are beyond the reach of any who would
promote an end by improper interference and solicitations.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Resolved further</em>, That a copy of the foregoing resolutions, duly attested,
be transmitted to each of our Senators, and to our Representative
in Congress, to be laid before their respective houses.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c010'><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Thus ended, so far as Delaware was concerned, the question
of compensated emancipation. Precisely why the offer
of Federal assistance was rejected nowhere clearly appears
except in the records of the General Assembly. The high
ground assumed in the resolutions was, of course, the only
one in harmony with public opinion in the State. There are,
however, some facts in the history of that Commonwealth
which afford a partial explanation of the action of its Legislature.
When the Federalist party as a political force had
disappeared everywhere outside of New England its principles
and traditions still lingered on in Delaware. The same
conservative tendency, the same distrust of innovation is seen
again in the prudent manner in which the authorities of the
State invested and improved her portion of the surplus revenue
distributed among the States in 1837. With a half dozen exceptions
the shares allotted to other members of the Union
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>have disappeared, in some instances expended patriotically,
in others squandered on projects more or less visionary. It
has frequently been observed, too, that a community whose
population is chiefly agricultural is apt to view with suspicion
any financial proposition of great magnitude. Whatever the
true explanation of her opposition to the policy of the President,
the question at once sank to rest in Delaware; it was
soon to be revived elsewhere, however, as will presently be
seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile army officers continued to determine, on their
own authority, very important questions relative to the surrender
of fugitive slaves. Major-General Halleck declared in
a proclamation of February 23, 1862, that “it does not belong
to the military to decide upon the relation of master and slave.
Such questions must be settled by the civil courts. No fugitive
slave will therefore be admitted within our lines or camps,
except when specially ordered by the General commanding.”<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c010'><sup>[240]</sup></a>
General Halleck’s order No. 3 of November 20 preceding, as it
cut off an opportunity for the escape of thousands, occasioned
much bitter discussion both in and out of Congress. By Halleck
it was explained in these words: “Unauthorized persons,
black or white, free or slaves, must be kept out of our
camps, unless we are willing to publish to the enemy everything
we do or intend to do.” This statement, however, does
not altogether harmonize with the spirit of his order.<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c010'><sup>[241]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>General Buell up to March 6 appears to have uniformly returned
this class of persons, and on the 26th of that month
General Hooker permitted nine citizens of Maryland to search
for negroes supposed to have taken refuge with some of the
regiments in his division. Notwithstanding the commander
desired that no obstacles be thrown in their way, trouble occurred
when the claimants showed their authority and demanded
the surrender of their slaves. They were driven from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>camp because fears for their safety were entertained by some
of the officers. The anger of the soldiers appears to have been
especially aroused by the fact that when within a few yards
of camp the slaveholders fired two pistol shots at a negro
who was running past them.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c010'><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>General Doubleday’s opinion, as stated April 6, 1862, by
the Assistant Adjutant-General, was, “that all negroes
coming into the lines of any of the camps or forts under his
command, are to be treated as persons and not as chattels.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Under no circumstances,” continues this regulation, “has
the commander of a fort or camp the power of surrendering
persons claimed as fugitive slaves, as it cannot be done without
determining their character.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The additional article of war recently passed by Congress
positively prohibits this.”<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c010'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding the unmistakable tone of the above, General
Williams announced two months later from his headquarters
at Baton Rouge that commanders of the camps and garrisons
in that part of Louisiana were required to turn all
fugitives beyond the limits of their guards and sentinels because
of “the demoralizing and disorganizing tendencies to
the troops of harboring runaway negroes.”<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c010'><sup>[244]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Enough has been said to show the divergence of sentiment
among Federal commanders on the rendition of fugitive slaves.
The party preferences of officers served as a rather reliable
index to the treatment of the fugitive in any particular case.
This confusion, it is scarcely necessary to add, arose from the
failure of Congress to pass a law on the subject, and to a
considerable degree from the absence of any clearly expressed
policy by the Administration. Of the changing opinions of the
President, however, we catch an occasional glimpse. Though
the contrabands at Fortress Monroe had, no doubt, brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>before him the entire question of slavery, the sagacity of
General Butler had postponed the necessity of any announcement
in May, 1861; but the subject could not always be
avoided, and the imprudence of Fremont forced a declaration
in September following. The events of another year were
destined to produce changes which even the wisest could not
then foresee.</p>

<p class='c000'>A new phase of this troublesome question resulted from
the capture, November 7, of Hilton Head, South Carolina,
and the Federal occupation of the Sea Islands, where the
labor of slaves abandoned by their masters was organized
under authority of the Treasury Department by Mr. E. L.
Pierce. This was, probably, intended as nothing more than an
experiment, to be extended if successful. To interest Government
officials at Washington in the work among these freedmen,
Mr. Pierce, at the suggestion of Secretary Chase, called,
February 15, 1862, upon the President, who seemed rather
annoyed at the visit, and, after listening a few moments, said
somewhat impatiently that he did not think he ought to be
troubled with such details; that “there seemed to be an itching
to get negroes into our lines.” To this Mr. Pierce replied
that the negroes were domiciled there when the Union
forces took possession. The President then handed his visitor
a card by which Mr. Chase was authorized to give what instructions
he thought judicious relative to Port Royal contrabands.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c010'><sup>[245]</sup></a>
This impatience Mr. Pierce explains by saying that
the President was in expectation of a personal bereavement.
This certainly accounts for the anxiety and apparent annoyance
of Mr. Lincoln, but his remark that there seemed to be
an “itching” to get negroes inside Federal lines shows that he
had not yet deliberately considered the novel case of abandoned
slaves; abandoned masters had hitherto claimed his attention.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Though slowly, as it may have appeared to radical members
of his own party, the President was surely approaching the
great question, and on March 6, 1862, sent to Congress a
message which recommended the adoption, and even proposed
the form, of a joint resolution declaring:</p>

<p class='c013'>That the United States ought to coöperate with any State which may
adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid,
to be used by such State, in its discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences,
public and private, produced by such change of system.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c010'><sup>[246]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As one of the most efficient means of self-preservation it
was recommended by the Executive to the coördinate branch
of Government; for to deprive the cotton States of the hope
of being joined by the border States would, he said, “substantially
end the rebellion; and the initiation of emancipation
completely deprives them of it as to all the States initiating it.
The point is not that all the States tolerating slavery would
very soon, if at all, initiate emancipation; but that while the
offer is equally made to all, the more Northern shall, by such
initiation, make it certain to the more Southern that in no
event will the former ever join the latter in their proposed
confederacy.” Gradual emancipation he believed better for all
concerned. The current expenditures of the war would soon
purchase, at a fair valuation, all the slaves in any named State.
However, it was proposed as a matter of perfectly free choice.
“In the annual message, last December,” continued the President,
“I thought fit to say, ‘the Union must be preserved, and
hence all indispensable means must be employed.’ I said this
not hastily, but deliberately. War has been made and continues
to be an indispensable means to this end. A practical
re-acknowledgment of the national authority would render the
war unnecessary, and it would at once cease. If, however,
resistance continues, the war must also continue; and it is
impossible to foresee all the incidents which may attend and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the ruin which may follow it. Such as may seem indispensable,
or may obviously promise great efficiency, toward ending
the struggle, must and will come.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The message inquired “whether the pecuniary consideration
tendered would not be of more value to the States and
private persons concerned than are the institution and property
in it, in the present aspect of affairs?”<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c010'><sup>[247]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This was really a great step in advance; by many it was
regarded as a direct and positive interference with the domestic
institutions of the States; it was certainly a preliminary
movement to get rid of slavery. The deliberate opinion of
the Delaware Legislature has already been noticed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Easily distinguished in principle from the opposition in
Delaware were the sentiments expressed in Virginia when the
equitable and generous proposal of the President came up for
consideration in the Richmond Legislature. Mr. Collier submitted
to that body a preamble and resolution relative to the
proposition. In the former it was said that negro slaves having
been the property of their masters for two hundred and
forty years, by use and custom at first, and subsequently by
recognition of the public law, ought not to be, and could not
justly be, interfered with in such property relation by the State,
by “the people in convention assembled to alter an existing
constitution, or to form one for admission into the confederacy,
nor by the representatives of the people of the State in the
Confederate Legislature, nor by any means or mode which
the popular majority might adopt; and that the State, whilst
remaining republican in the structure of its government, can
lawfully get rid of that species of property, if ever, only by the
free consent of the individual owners.” For the State to deprive
an individual of this species of property would contravene
the indispensable principles of free government. This
view, as further explained by its author, denied the power of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>even a majority, in making a new State constitution, to disturb
a preëxisting and resident property.<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c010'><sup>[248]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Three days after sending his recommendation to Congress,
the President wrote privately to Henry J. Raymond, editor of
the <cite>New York Times</cite>:</p>

<p class='c013'>I am grateful to the New York journals and not less so to the
“Times” than to others, for their kind notices of the late special message
to Congress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Your paper, however, intimates that the proposition, though well intentioned,
must fail on the score of expense. I do hope you will reconsider
this. Have you noticed the facts that less than one-half day’s cost of this
war would pay for all the slaves in Delaware at $400 per head—that
eighty-seven days’ cost of this war would pay for all in Delaware, Maryland,
District of Columbia, Kentucky, and Missouri at the same price?
Were those States to take the step, do you doubt that it would shorten
the war more than eighty-seven days, and thus be an actual saving of
expense?</p>

<p class='c013'>Please look at these things and consider whether there should not be
another article in the “Times.”<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c010'><sup>[249]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>By his request those Congressmen from the border States
then in Washington called, March 10, on Mr. Lincoln, who
explained that his recent message was not inimical to the interests
they represented. In the progress of the war, slaves
would come into camps and continual irritation be thus maintained.
In the border States that condition kept alive a feeling
of hostility to the Government. He told them further “that
emancipation was a subject exclusively under the control of
the States, and must be adopted or rejected by each for
itself.”<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c010'><sup>[250]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Relative to this interview a memorandum of the Hon. John
W. Crisfield, one of the Maryland Representatives present,
contains the following entry: “He [the President] was constantly
annoyed by conflicting and antagonistic complaints; on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the one side a certain class complained if the slave was not
protected by the army; persons were frequently found who,
participating in these views, acted in a way unfriendly to the
slave-holder; on the other hand, slaveholders complained that
their rights were interfered with, their slaves induced to abscond
and protected within the lines; these complaints were
numerous, loud and deep; were a serious annoyance to him
and embarrassing to the progress of the war ... [they]
strengthened the hopes of the Confederates that at some day
the border States would unite with them, and thus tend to prolong
the war; and he was of opinion, if this resolution should
be adopted by Congress and accepted by our [the border slaveholding]
States, these causes of irritation and these hopes
would be removed, and more would be accomplished toward
shortening the war than could be hoped from the greatest victory
achieved by Union armies; ... that he did not
claim nor had this Government any right to coerce them”
to accept the proposition.</p>

<p class='c000'>To Mr. Noell’s remark that the <cite>New York Tribune</cite> favored
the measure and understood it to mean that gradual emancipation
must be accepted or the border States would get something
worse, the President replied that he must not be expected
to quarrel with that journal before the right time; he
hoped never to have to do it. The message having said that
“all indispensable means must be employed” to preserve the
Union, Mr. Crisfield inquired pointedly, what would be the
effect of the refusal of a State to accept this proposal. Did
the President, he asked, look “to any policy beyond the acceptance
or rejection of this scheme.” Mr. Lincoln candidly replied
that he had “no designs beyond the action of the States
on this particular subject,” though he should lament their
refusal to accept it. Mr. Crisfield said “he did not think the
people of Maryland looked upon slavery as a permanent institution;
and he did not know that they would be very reluctant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>to give it up if provision was made to meet the loss
and they could be rid of the race; but they did not like to
be coerced into emancipation, either by the direct action of
the Government or by indirection, as through the emancipation
of slaves in this District, or the confiscation of Southern
property as now threatened; and he thought before they would
consent to consider this proposition they would require to be
informed on these points.” The President answered that
“unless he was expelled by the act of God or the Confederate
armies, he should occupy that house for three years; and as
long as he remained there Maryland had nothing to fear
either for her institutions or her interests on the points referred
to.” Representative Crisfield immediately added: “Mr. President,
if what you now say could be heard by the people of
Maryland, they would consider your proposition with a much
better feeling than I fear without it they will be inclined to
do.” To this Mr. Lincoln said that a publication of his sentiments
would not do; it would force him before the proper
time into a quarrel which was impending with the Greeley
faction. This he desired to postpone, or, if possible, altogether
to avoid.</p>

<p class='c000'>To an objection of Governor Wickliffe, of Kentucky, he said
that the resolution proposed would be considered rather as
the expression of a sentiment than as involving any constitutional
question. He did not know how the project was received
by the members from the free States; some of them had
spoken to him and received it kindly; but for the most part
they were as reserved and chary as the border State delegations;
he could not tell how they would vote.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c010'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>To James A. McDougall, of California, who was making
some opposition in the Senate, he sent, March 14, this private
communication while the resolution was still pending:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>As to the expensiveness of gradual emancipation with the plan of

<p class='c013'>Do you doubt that taking the initiatory steps on the part of those
States and this District would shorten the war more than eighty-seven
days, and thus be an actual saving of expense?</p>

<p class='c013'>A word as to the time and manner of incurring the expense.
Suppose, for instance, a State devises and adopts a system by which
the institution absolutely ceases therein by a named day—say January
1, 1882. Then let the sum to be paid to such a State by the United
States be ascertained by taking from the census of 1860 the number
of slaves within the State, and multiplying the number by four hundred—the
United States to pay such sums to the State in twenty equal
annual installments, in six per cent. bonds of the United States.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sum thus given, as to time and manner, I think, would not be
half as onerous as would be an equal sum raised now for the indefinite
prosecution of the war; but of this you can judge as well as I. I
enclose a census table for your convenience.<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c010'><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>On the same day of the conference with the border State
delegations, March 10, the resolution, in precisely the language
suggested by the President, was introduced by Roscoe
Conkling, and on the following day by a vote of 89 to 31
passed the House.<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c010'><sup>[253]</sup></a> The Senate by 32 yeas to 10 nays took
favorable action upon it on the 2d of April succeeding.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c010'><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is important to notice that at this time, March, 1862,
the Government set up no claim of a right by Federal authority
to interfere with slavery within the limits of a State; also
that public opinion in the North had advanced to the position
occupied by Representative McKean more than a year before,
when he introduced into Congress his resolution for compensated
emancipation.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c010'><sup>[255]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>At a session, May 28, 1862, of the Union Convention of
Baltimore its Business Committee reported a series of resolutions
which were adopted unanimously, among them one approving
the wise and conservative policy proposed by the
President in his message of March 6; that it was not only
the duty but the interest of the loyal people of Maryland to
accept the offer of pecuniary aid tendered by the Government
to inaugurate an equitable plan of emancipation and colonization.<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c010'><sup>[256]</sup></a>
This was the dawn of emancipation in Maryland.</p>

<p class='c000'>The President approved, April 16, six days after the passage
of his cherished measure, an act prohibiting slavery and liberating
slaves in the District of Columbia. It included both compensation
to owners and the principle of colonization.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c010'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Shortly before its passage, April 17, a resolution was favorably
considered by the House to appoint a committee of nine
empowered to report whether any plan could be proposed and
recommended for the gradual emancipation of all African
slaves and the extinction of slavery in Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri by the people or
local authorities thereof, and how far and in what way the
United States could and ought equitably to aid in facilitating
either of the above objects. This measure was adopted by
a vote of 67 to 52, and one week later a committee was appointed
by the Speaker.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Hunter by an order of April 25 had extended
martial law over South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. Two
weeks later he proclaimed persons in those States heretofore
held as slaves forever free. “Slavery and martial law in a
free country” he declared “altogether incompatible.” The
President in his proclamation of May 19, 1862, rescinding this
order once more reveals his sentiments on the slavery question.
The act of the Department commander, he said, was
wholly unauthorized. The document continues: “I further
make known that, whether it be competent for me, as Commander-in-Chief
of the army and navy, to declare the slaves
of any State or States free, and whether, at any time, in any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>case, it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the
maintenance of the Government to exercise such supposed
power, are questions which, under my responsibility, I reserve
to myself, and which I cannot feel justified in leaving to the
decision of commanders in the field.”<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c010'><sup>[258]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Lincoln took this opportunity to point out to those most
nearly concerned the unmistakable signs of the times, and
earnestly appealed to them to embrace the offer of compensated
abolishment, quoting upon that subject the joint resolution of
Congress. The order of General Hunter, so far as it concerned
the President, could have been dismissed by its disavowal;
but he went farther: he not only took advantage of
this occasion earnestly to urge upon the border States very
serious consideration of the principle of compensated emancipation,
but he raised, without pausing to discuss it, the question
of his right as Commander-in-Chief of the army and
navy to declare the freedom of slaves within the limits of a
State should such a measure become indispensable to the
maintenance of the Union.</p>

<p class='c000'>For refusing to employ his regiment in returning fugitive
slaves of disloyal masters, Colonel Paine, of the Fourth Wisconsin
Volunteers, was placed under arrest in the summer of
1862; about the same time Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony was
similarly disciplined both for refusing permission to search
his camp and for ordering the arrest of those hunting for
slaves.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c010'><sup>[259]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Instructions from the War Department, dated July 22, and
applying to all the States in rebellion except South Carolina
and Tennessee, authorized the employment as laborers of so
many persons of African descent as the military and naval
commanders could use to advantage, and the payment of reasonable
wages for their labor.<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c010'><sup>[260]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>On May 12, 1862, Representative Lovejoy proposed a bill,
a substitute for one previously reported by him and introduced
by Mr. Isaac N. Arnold:</p>

<p class='c013'>To the end that freedom may be and remain forever the fundamental
law of the land in all places whatsoever, so far as it lies within
the powers or depends upon the action of the Government of the United
States to make it so: Therefore,</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled</em>, That slavery or involuntary
servitude, in all cases whatsoever (other than in the punishment
of crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted) shall henceforth
cease, and be prohibited forever in all the Territories of the
United States, now existing, or hereafter to be formed or acquired in
any way.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c010'><sup>[261]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This measure passed by 85 yeas to 50 nays. In the Senate,
June 9, it was reported amended by inserting this substitute:
“That from and after the passage of this act there shall be
neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of the Territories
of the United States now existing, or which may at
any time hereafter be formed or acquired by the United States,
otherwise than in punishment of crimes whereof the party
shall have been duly convicted.” In this form it passed by a
vote of 28 to 10 and the House concurred by 72 yeas to 38
nays.<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c010'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Charles Sumner, writing June 5, 1862, to a correspondent
who was impatient at what seemed the short-comings of the
President, says:</p>

<p class='c013'>Your criticism of the President is hasty. I am confident that, if you
knew him as I do, you would not make it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of course, the President cannot be held responsible for all the misfeasances
of subordinates, unless adopted or at least tolerated by him.
And I am sure that nothing unjust or ungenerous will be tolerated, much
less adopted, by him.</p>

<p class='c013'>I am happy to let you know that he has no sympathy with Stanly in his
absurd wickedness, closing the schools, nor again in his other act of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>turning our camp into a hunting ground for slaves. He repudiates
both—positively. The latter point has occupied much of his thought;
and the newspapers have not gone too far in recording his repeated
declarations, which I have often heard from his own lips, that slaves
finding their way into the national lines are never to be re-enslaved.
This is his conviction, expressed without reserve.</p>

<p class='c013'>Could you have seen the President—as it was my privilege often—while
he was considering the great questions on which he has already
acted—the invitation to emancipation in the States, emancipation in the
District of Columbia, and the acknowledgment of the independence of
Hayti and Liberia—even your zeal would have been satisfied, for you
would have felt the sincerity of his purpose to do what he could to
carry forward the principles of the Declaration of Independence. His
whole soul was occupied, especially by the first proposition, which was
peculiarly his own. In familiar intercourse with him, I remember
nothing more touching than the earnestness and completeness with
which he embraced this idea. To his mind, it was just and beneficent
while it promised the sure end of slavery. Of course, to me who had
already proposed a bridge of gold for the retreating fiend, it was
most welcome. Proceeding from the President, it must take its place
among the great events of history.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>I wish that you really knew the President, and had heard the artless
expression of his convictions on these questions which concern you so
deeply. You might, perhaps, wish that he were less cautious, but you
would be grateful that he is so true to all that you have at heart.
Believe me, therefore, you are wrong, and I regret it the more because
of my desire to see all our friends stand firmly together.<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c010'><sup>[263]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The President requested and obtained, July 12, 1862, an
interview with the border State delegations. The near adjournment
of Congress would deprive him of an opportunity
of seeing them for several months. He believed they held
more power for good than any other equal number of members,
and felt that the duty of making an appeal to them
could not be waived. This he did by reading a carefully
prepared paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Confederate States, he said, would cling to the hope of
an ultimate union with the border States as long as they perpetuated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>the institution of slavery. If the members had supported
his plan of gradual emancipation in the preceding
March the rebellion would now, 1862, be substantially ended.</p>

<p class='c000'>Looking to the stern facts in the case he inquired whether
they could do better for their States than to follow the course
which he urged. If the war continued long, the institution
“will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion,”—by
the incidents of war much of its value was already gone. He
did not speak of immediate emancipation, “but of a decision
at once to emancipate gradually.” Room for colonization
could be procured in South America ample and cheap enough.
When their numbers increased sufficiently to be company for
one another the freed people would not be so reluctant to
go. His repudiation of General Hunter’s proclamation had
given offence to some whose support the Government could
not afford to lose. The pressure from such persons was still
upon him and the Congressmen from the border slave States
could relieve him and the country. He begged them to reexamine
his message of March 6, and commend it to the
consideration of their constituents. The peril of their common
country demanded the loftiest views and the boldest action if
they desired to perpetuate popular government.<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c010'><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It was represented to him, in a conversation which followed
this appeal, that the resolution of Congress, being no more
than an expression of sentiment, could not be regarded by them
as a basis for substantial action. Mr. Lincoln admitted that,
as a condition of taking into consideration a proposition so
nearly affecting their social system, the border slave States
were entitled to expect a substantial pledge of pecuniary
aid.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was further represented at this conference that the people
of the border States were interested in knowing the great importance
which Mr. Lincoln attached to the policy in question,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>while it was equally due to the country, to the President
and to themselves that they should publicly announce the
motives under which they were called to act, and the considerations
of public policy urged upon them and their constituents.
With a view to such a statement of their position the members
met in council to deliberate on the reply they should make,
and two days later the majority sent the following paper to
the President:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The undersigned ... have listened to your address
with the profound sensibility naturally inspired by the
high source from which it emanates, the earnestness which
marked its delivery, and the overwhelming importance of the
subject of which it treats. We have given it our most respectful
consideration, and now lay before you our response....</p>

<p class='c000'>“... Repudiating the dangerous heresies of the
secessionists, we believed, with you, that the war on their
part is aggressive and wicked, and the objects for which it
was to be prosecuted on ours, defined by your message at the
opening of the present Congress, to be such as all good men
should approve. We have not hesitated to vote all supplies
necessary to carry it on vigorously....”</p>

<p class='c000'>This support, continues the response, was yielded “in the
face of measures most distasteful to us and injurious to the
interests we represent, and in the hearing of doctrines, avowed
by those who claim to be your friends, [which] must be
abhorrent to us and our constituents.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The greater number of them did not, however, vote for the
measure recommended in his message of March 6, and they
proceeded to state the principal reasons which influenced their
action. First, it proposed a radical change in their social system;
it was hurried through both Houses with undue haste;
and was passed without any opportunity whatever for consultation
with their constituents, whose interests it deeply involved.
“It seemed,” said the majority, “like an interference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>by this Government with a question which peculiarly and exclusively
belonged to our respective States, on which they had
not sought advice or solicited aid. Many of us doubted the
constitutional power of this Government to make appropriations
of money for the object designated, and all of us thought
our finances were in no condition to bear the immense outlay
which its adoption and faithful execution would impose upon
the national Treasury. If we pause but a moment to think of
the debt its acceptance would have entailed, we are appalled by
its magnitude. The proposition was addressed to all the
States and embraced the whole number of slaves.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The census of 1860 showed a slave population of nearly
4,000,000; from natural increase the number in 1862 exceeded
that. “At even the low average of $300, the price
fixed by the emancipation act for the slaves of this District,
and greatly below their real worth, their value runs up to the
enormous sum of $1,200,000,000; and if to that we add the
cost of deportation and colonization, at $100 each, which is
but a fraction more than is actually paid by the Maryland
Colonization Society, we have $400,000,000 more. They were
not willing nor could the country bear a tax sufficient to pay
the interest on that sum in addition to the vast and daily increasing
debt already fixed upon them by the exigencies of
the war. The proposition is nothing less than the deportation
from the country of $1,600,000,000 worth of producing labor
and the substitution of an interest-bearing debt of the same
amount. Even if it were expected that only the border States
would accept the proposition, that involved a sum too great
for the financial ability of the Government at this time. The
total number of slaves in those States according to the late
census was 1,196,112. The same rate of valuation with expenses
of deportation and colonization gives the enormous
sum of $478,038,133.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We did not feel that we should be justified in voting for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>measure which, if carried out, would add this vast amount to
our public debt at a moment when the Treasury was reeling
under the enormous expenditure of the war.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To them the resolution seemed no more than the enunciation
of a sentiment. “No movement was then made to provide and
appropriate the funds required to carry it into effect; and we
were not encouraged to believe that funds would be provided.
And our belief has been fully justified by subsequent events.
Not to mention other circumstances, it is quite sufficient for
our purpose to bring to your notice the fact that, while this
resolution was under consideration in the Senate our colleague,
the Senator from Kentucky, moved an amendment appropriating
$500,000 to the object therein designated, and it was
voted down with great unanimity. What confidence, then,
could we reasonably feel that if we committed ourselves to
the policy it proposed, our constituents would reap the fruits
of the promise held out; and on what ground could we, as
fair men, approach them and challenge their support?”</p>

<p class='c000'>They denied that if, as the President alleged, they had
supported the resolution of March 6, the war would be substantially
ended, and they added, “The resolution has passed
and if there be virtue in it, it will be quite as efficacious as if
we had voted for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The war, they asserted, was prolonged not by reason of
their conduct, but because of the union of all classes in the
South. Those who wished to break down national independence
and set up State domination, the State-rights party,
could not be reconciled; but the large class who believed their
domestic interests had been assailed by the Government might
be if only they were convinced “that no harm is intended to
them and their institutions,” but that the Government was
simply defending its legitimate authority.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Twelve months ago,” adds this response, “both Houses
of Congress, adopting the spirit of your message, then but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>recently sent in, declared with singular unanimity the objects
of the war, and the country instantly bounded to your side
to assist you in carrying it on. If the spirit of that resolution
had been adhered to, we are confident that we should before
now have seen the end of this deplorable conflict. But what
have we seen?</p>

<p class='c000'>“In both Houses of Congress we have heard doctrines subversive
of the principles of the Constitution, and seen measure
after measure founded in substance on those doctrines proposed
and carried through which can have no other effect than
to distract and divide loyal men, and exasperate and drive still
further from us and their duty the people of the rebellious
States. Military officers, following these bad examples, have
stepped beyond the just limits of their authority in the same
direction, until in several instances you have felt the necessity
of interfering to arrest them.... The effect of these
measures was foretold, and may now be seen in the indurated
state of Southern feeling.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To these causes, and not to the failure of the border delegations
to support the measure, they attributed the terrible earnestness
of those in arms against the Government. Nor was
the institution of slavery the source of insurgent strength,
but rather the apprehension that the powers of a common
Government would be wielded against the institutions of the
Southern States.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reply concludes: “If Congress, by proper and necessary
legislation, shall provide sufficient funds and place them
at your disposal, to be applied by you to the payment of any
of our States or the citizens thereof who shall adopt the abolishment
of slavery, either gradual or immediate, as they may
determine, and the expense of deportation and colonization of
the liberated slaves, then will our State[s] and people take this
proposition into careful consideration, for such decision as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>in their judgment is demanded by their interest, their honor,
and their duty to the whole country.”<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c010'><sup>[265]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The minority, seven in number, in their reply of the 15th
declared themselves ready to make any sacrifice to save the
Government and the institutions of their fathers, and promised
to ask the people of their States calmly, deliberately and fairly
to consider the recommendations of the President; they were
encouraged to assume this position because the leaders of the
rebellion had offered to abolish slavery among them as a
condition of foreign intervention in favor of their independence
as a nation.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c010'><sup>[266]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Horace Maynard, though not representing a border State
proper, expressed his approval of the President’s policy and
stated the physical impossibility of submitting to the consideration
of his people that or any other proposition until Tennessee
had first been freed from hostile arms.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c010'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A fourth paper submitted to the President was that of
Senator J. B. Henderson, of Missouri, who had cheerfully
supported the measure at the time of its introduction; he
believed the proposition would have received the approbation
of a large majority of the border State delegations if they
could have foreseen that the war would have been protracted
a twelvemonth and had felt assured that the dominant party in
Congress would, like the President, be as prompt in practical
action as they had been in the expression of a sentiment. “In
this period of the nation’s distress,” says Senator Henderson,
“I know of no human institution too sacred for discussion;
no material interest belonging to the citizen that he should not
willingly place upon the altar of his country, if demanded by
the public good.”<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c010'><sup>[268]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Henderson did not agree with the opinion of the President
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>that “the war would now be substantially ended” had
the members from the border States supported the measure
in the preceding March. Personally he was favorable to the
proposition, but remembered that he was the servant not the
master of the people of Missouri.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the sudden and unexpected collapse of McClellan’s
Richmond campaign has been ascribed the determination of
President Lincoln to adopt general military emancipation so
much sooner than he otherwise would have done. The great
and decisive element of military strength in the slave population
which he saw so clearly a little later could not even then,
June and July, 1862, have been altogether concealed from his
keen insight into affairs. His personal appeal to the border
Congressmen was made July 12; the result of that conference
he easily anticipated. Nor was the receipt of their written
replies necessary to inform him that his offer would be rejected.
So much he could readily collect from their oral
objections and verbal criticisms. The decision to give notice
of his intention to issue a proclamation concerning slavery was
probably made within a few hours after he had assured Mr.
Crisfield that the emancipation policy extended no farther than
to a refusal of the border States to accept his tender of pecuniary
aid to any commonwealth voluntarily adopting the plan of
gradual abolishment. However this may be, he confided on
the following day, July 13, 1862, to Secretaries Seward and
Welles his intention to emancipate slaves by proclamation
if their masters did not cease to make war on the Government.
From the diary of the latter, we learn under what
circumstances this important communication was made.</p>

<p class='c013'>President Lincoln [writes Mr. Welles] invited me to accompany him in
his carriage to the funeral of an infant child of Mr. Stanton. Secretary
Seward and Mrs. Frederick Seward were also in the carriage. Mr.
Stanton occupied at that time, for a summer residence, the house of a
naval officer, some two or three miles west or northwesterly of Georgetown.
It was on this occasion and on this ride that he first mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>to Mr. Seward and myself the subject of emancipating the slaves by
proclamation in case the rebels did not cease to persist in their war
on the Government and the Union, of which he saw no evidence. He
dwelt earnestly on the gravity, importance, and delicacy of the movement;
said he had given it much thought, and had about come to the
conclusion that it was a military necessity, absolutely essential for the
salvation of the nation, that we must free the slaves or be ourselves subdued,
etc., etc. This was, he said, the first occasion where he had
mentioned the subject to any one, and wished us to frankly state how the
proposition struck us. Mr. Seward said the subject involved consequences
so vast and momentous that he should wish to bestow on it
mature reflection before giving a decisive answer; but his present
opinion inclined to the measure as justifiable, and perhaps he might say
expedient and necessary. These were also my views. Two or three
times on that ride the subject, which was of course an absorbing one
for each and all, was adverted to, and before separating, the President
desired us to give the subject special and deliberate attention, for he
was earnest in the conviction that something must be done. It was
a new departure for the President, for until this time, in all our previous
interviews, whenever the question of emancipation or the mitigation
of slavery had been in any way alluded to, he had been prompt
and emphatic in denouncing any interference by the General Government
with the subject. This was, I think, the sentiment of every
member of the Cabinet, all of whom, including the President, considered
it a local domestic question appertaining to the States respectively,
who had never parted with their authority over it. But the
reverses before Richmond, and the formidable power and dimensions
of the insurrection, which extended through all the slave States and had
combined most of them in a confederacy to destroy the Union, impelled
the Administration to adopt extraordinary measures to preserve
the national existence. The slaves, if not armed and disciplined, were
in the service of those who were, not only as field laborers and producers,
but thousands of them were in attendance upon the armies in
the field, employed as waiters and teamsters, and the fortifications and
intrenchments were constructed by them.<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c010'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The session of Congress was drawing to a close, but before
adjournment the Confiscation Act, passed July 17, 1862, was
approved by the President. This with kindred laws increased
the number of forfeitures of title to slaves for the crimes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>treason and rebellion. These penalties were by him considered
just and their imposition constitutional.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within five days after the adjournment of Congress the
President, July 21, 1862, reached his final conclusions on the
subject of emancipation. The diary of Secretary Chase contains
the following record:</p>

<p class='c013'>[Having received notice of a Cabinet meeting, Mr. Chase says:] I
went to the President’s at the appointed hour and found that he was
profoundly concerned at the present aspect of affairs, and had determined
to take some definite steps in respect to military action and
slavery. He had prepared several orders, the first of which contemplated
authority to commanders to subsist their troops in the hostile
territory; the second, authority to employ negroes as laborers; the third,
requiring that both in case of property taken and negroes employed,
accounts should be kept with such degree of certainty as would enable
compensation to be made in proper cases. Another provided for the
colonization of negroes in some tropical country.</p>

<p class='c013'>A good deal of discussion took place upon these points. The first
order was unanimously approved. The second was also unanimously
approved; and the third by all except myself. I doubted the expediency
of attempting to keep accounts for the benefit of inhabitants of rebel
States. The colonization project was not much discussed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Secretary of War presented some letters from General Hunter, in
which General Hunter advised the Department that the withdrawal of a
large proportion of his troops to reënforce General McClellan rendered
it highly important that he should be immediately authorized to enlist
all loyal persons without reference to complexion. Mr. Stanton, Mr.
Seward, and myself expressed ourselves in favor of this plan, and no
one expressed himself against it. Mr. Blair was not present. The
President was not prepared to decide the question, but expressed
himself as averse to arming negroes.<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c010'><sup>[270]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This Cabinet meeting came to no final conclusion, and, as
we learn from the same source, the discussion was resumed on
the following day, July 22, when the question of arming the
slaves was brought up.</p>

<p class='c013'>I advocated it warmly [writes Secretary Chase].<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c010'><sup>[271]</sup></a> The President was
unwilling to adopt this measure, but proposed to issue a proclamation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>on the basis of the Confiscation Bill, calling upon the States to return
to their allegiance—warning rebels that the provisions of the act would
have full force at the expiration of sixty days—adding, on his own part,
a declaration of his intention to renew, at the next session of Congress,
his recommendation of compensation to States adopting gradual abolishment
of slavery—and proclaiming the emancipation of all slaves
within States remaining in insurrection on the first day of January, 1863.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c010'><sup>[272]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Chase promised the measure his cordial support, but
preferred that no new expression on the subject of compensation
be made at that time. Secretary Chase, in the diary mentioned,
says: “The impression left upon my mind by the
whole discussion was, that, while the President thought that
the organization, equipment, and arming of negroes, like other
soldiers, would be productive of more evil than good, he was
not unwilling that commanders should, at their discretion, arm
for purely defensive purposes, slaves coming within their
lines.”<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c010'><sup>[273]</sup></a> On the kindred policy of emancipation, however,
the President had reached a definite conclusion which was in
advance of the opinions entertained by even the most radical
members of his Cabinet. When, therefore, he read to them,
on July 22, his draft of an emancipation proclamation they
were for the most part taken completely by surprise. This
momentous document deserves to be reproduced entire.</p>

<p class='c013'>In pursuance of the sixth section of the act of Congress entitled “An
act to suppress insurrection and to punish treason and rebellion, to
seize and confiscate property of rebels, and for other purposes,” approved
July 17, 1862, and which act and the joint resolution explanatory
thereof are herewith published, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
United States, do hereby proclaim to and warn all persons within the
contemplation of said sixth section to cease participating in, aiding,
countenancing, or abetting the existing rebellion, or any rebellion,
against the Government of the United States, and to return to their
proper allegiance to the United States, on pain of the forfeitures and
seizures as within and by said sixth section provided.</p>

<p class='c013'>And I hereby make known that it is my purpose, upon the next
meeting of Congress, to again recommend the adoption of a practical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>measure for tendering pecuniary aid to the free choice or rejection of any
and all States which may then be recognizing and practically sustaining
the authority of the United States, and which may then have voluntarily
adopted, or thereafter may voluntarily adopt, gradual abolishment
of slavery within such State or States; that the object is to practically
restore, thenceforward to be maintained, the constitutional relation
between the General Government and each and all the States wherein
that relation is now suspended or disturbed; and that for this object
the war, as it has been, will be prosecuted. And as a fit and necessary
military measure for effecting this object, I as Commander-in-Chief
of the army and navy of the United States, do order and declare that on
the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight
hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State
or States wherein the constitutional authority of the United States
shall not then be practically recognized, submitted to, and maintained,
shall then, thenceforward, and forever be free.<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c010'><sup>[274]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The diary of Secretary Chase, as well as the President’s
endorsement on his draft, shows the emancipation proclamation
to have been read to the Cabinet July 22, 1862. Various
suggestions were offered; but except an objection of Secretary
Seward they had all been fully anticipated by Mr. Lincoln
and settled in his own mind. Secretary Seward said: “Mr.
President, I approve of the proclamation, but I question the
expediency of its issue at this juncture. The depression of
the public mind, consequent upon our repeated reverses, is so
great that I fear the effect of so important a step. It may be
viewed as the last measure of an exhausted Government, a
cry for help; the Government stretching forth its hands to
Ethiopia, instead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to the
Government.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking afterwards of this incident, Mr. Lincoln said:
“Seward’s idea was ‘that it would be considered our last
<em>shriek</em> on the retreat. Now,’ added Mr. Seward, ‘while I
approve the measure, I suggest, sir, that you postpone its issue,
until you can give it to the country supported by military success,
instead of issuing it, as would be the case now, upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>greatest disasters of the war!’ The wisdom of this view,”
said Mr. Lincoln in recalling the occasion, “struck me with
very great force. It was an aspect of the case that, in all my
thought upon the subject, I had entirely overlooked. The
result was that I put the draft of the proclamation aside, as
you do your sketch for a picture, waiting for a victory.”<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c010'><sup>[275]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Instead of the proclamation so carefully discussed, a short
one was published three days later, of which the most important
part is as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>In pursuance of the sixth section of the act of Congress entitled
“An act to suppress insurrection and to punish treason and rebellion,
to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes,”
approved July 17, 1862, and which act, and the joint resolution explanatory
thereof, are herewith published, I, Abraham Lincoln, President
of the United States, do hereby proclaim to and warn all persons
within the contemplation of said sixth section to cease participating in,
aiding, countenancing, or abetting the existing rebellion, or any rebellion,
against the Government of the United States, and to return to their
proper allegiance to the United States, on pain of the forfeitures and
seizures as within and by said sixth section provided.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c010'><sup>[276]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This warning was required by the sixth section of the act
mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the following month President Lincoln waited patiently
for tidings of some unquestioned success that would
justify the publication of his proclamation, but when instead
he received in the closing days of August intelligence of the
second disaster at Manassas his anxiety must have become intense.
This victory, together with the succession of others recently
attending Confederate arms, encouraged General Lee’s
invasion of Maryland. An army, notwithstanding its late reverses,
still formidable in numbers and once more thoroughly
reorganized marched leisurely from the vicinity of Washington
to locate and destroy him. When, where or how the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>battle-cloud would break was uncertain. All eyes were turned
on McClellan, again in command of the Union forces and
strengthened by every soldier that could be spared from the
defences of the Federal capital. It was in this state of suspense,
and on the very day, September 13, that Lee’s victorious
legions entered Frederick City that the President gave audience
to a deputation from the religious denominations of
Chicago, presenting a memorial for the immediate issue of an
emancipation proclamation, which was enforced by some remarks
from the chairman. The President replied that he had
for weeks past, even for months, thought much upon the
subject of their memorial.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am approached,” said he, “with the most opposite
opinions and advice, and that by religious men, who are
equally certain that they represent the Divine will. I am
sure that either the one or the other class is mistaken in that
belief, and perhaps, in some respect, both. I hope it will not
be irreverent for me to say that if it is probable that God
would reveal His will to others, on a point so connected with
my duty, it might be supposed He would reveal it directly to
me; for, unless I am more deceived in myself than I often am,
it is my earnest desire to know the will of Providence in this
matter. And if I can learn what it is I will do it! These
are not, however, the days of miracles, and I suppose it will
be granted that I am not to expect a direct revelation. I must
study the plain physical facts of the case, ascertain what is
possible, and learn what appears to be wise and right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The difficulties of the subject and the impossibility of even
anti-slavery men, in or out of Congress, agreeing upon any
measure of emancipation were then referred to. However, he
would discuss the merits of the case and asked pointedly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What good would a proclamation of emancipation from
me do, especially as we are now situated? I do not want to
issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>be inoperative.... Would my word free the
slaves, when I cannot even enforce the Constitution in the
rebel States? Is there a single court, or magistrate, or individual
that would be influenced by it there?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He admitted to his visitors, however, that he raised no
objections to such a proclamation as they desired on legal or
on constitutional grounds; for, continued he, “as Commander-in-Chief
of the Army and Navy, in time of war I suppose I
have a right to take any measure which may best subdue the
enemy, nor do I urge objections of a moral nature, in view of
possible consequences of insurrection and massacre at the
South. I view this matter as a practical war measure, to be
decided on according to the advantages or disadvantages it
may offer to the suppression of the rebellion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The committee replied, and the President added, “I admit
that slavery is at the root of the rebellion.... I will
also concede that emancipation would help us in Europe, and
convince them that we are incited by something more than
ambition. I grant, further, that it would help somewhat at
the North, though not so much, I fear, as you and those you
represent imagine.... Unquestionably, it would weaken the
rebels by drawing off their laborers, which is of great importance;
but I am not so sure we could do much with the blacks.”<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c010'><sup>[277]</sup></a>
The President, too, called attention to the fact that the border
slave States had 50,000 bayonets in the Union army. It
would be a serious matter if in consequence of such a proclamation
they should go over to the South. In conclusion he
said that he had not decided against a proclamation of liberty
to the slaves, but held the matter under advisement and assured
them that the subject was on his mind by day and by night
more than any other.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was currently reported among anti-slavery men in
Illinois that the emancipation proclamation was extorted from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>the President by the pressure of such delegations as this from
the Christian Convention.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c010'><sup>[278]</sup></a> To determine how little foundation
there is for this opinion it is only necessary to recall what
had occurred in the Cabinet on July 22 preceding.</p>

<p class='c000'>The repulse of Lee’s veterans at Antietam, September 17,
1862, raised somewhat the hopes of the President. On the
19th General McClellan telegraphed an account of his victory,
and Mr. Lincoln three days later announced his intention to
issue the postponed proclamation.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the Cabinet members, having been summoned by messenger
from the State Department, were in attendance at the
White House on September 22, 1862. After some talk of a
general nature, and the reading by Mr. Lincoln of a humorous
chapter from a book by Artemus Ward, the conversation assumed
a more serious tone. What subsequently transpired on
that eventful occasion we learn from the following record in
the diary of Secretary Chase:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gentlemen, [said the President] I have, as you are aware, thought a
great deal about the relation of this war to slavery, and you all remember
that, several weeks ago, I read to you an order I had prepared upon the
subject, which, on account of objections made by some of you, was not
issued. Ever since then my mind has been much occupied with this subject,
and I have thought all along that the time for acting on it might
probably come. I think the time has come now. I wish it was a
better time. I wish that we were in a better condition. The action of
the army against the rebels has not been quite what I should have
best liked. But they have been driven out of Maryland, and Pennsylvania
is no longer in danger of invasion. When the rebel army was
at Frederick I determined, as soon as it should be driven out of Maryland,
to issue a proclamation of emancipation, such as I thought most
likely to be useful. I said nothing to any one, but I made a promise to
myself and [hesitating a little] to my Maker. The rebel army is now
driven out, and I am going to fulfill that promise. I have got you
together to hear what I have written down. I do not wish your advice
about the main matter, for that I have determined for myself. This
I say without intending anything but respect for any one of you. But
I already know the views of each on this question. They have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>heretofore expressed, and I have considered them as thoroughly and
as carefully as I can. What I have written is that which my reflections
have determined me to say. If there is anything in the expressions
I use or in any minor matter which any one of you thinks had
best be changed, I shall be glad to receive your suggestions. One other
observation I will make. I know very well that many others might,
in this matter as in others, do better than I can; and if I was satisfied
that the public confidence was more fully possessed by any one
of them than by me, and knew of any constitutional way in which he
could be put in my place, he should have it. I would gladly yield
it to him. But though I believe that I have not so much of the
confidence of the people as I had some time since, I do not know
that, all things considered, any other person has more; and, however
this may be, there is no way in which I can have any other man put
where I am. I am here. I must do the best I can, and bear the
responsibility of taking the course which I feel I ought to take.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The President then proceeded to read his Emancipation Proclamation,
making remarks on the several parts as he went on, and showing that
he had fully considered the subject in all the lights under which it had
been presented to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>After he had closed, Governor Seward said: “The general question
having been decided, nothing can be said further about that. Would
it not, however, make the proclamation more clear and decided to
leave out all reference to the act being sustained during the incumbency
of the present President; and not merely say that the Government
<em>recognises</em>, but that it will maintain the freedom it proclaims?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I followed, saying: “What you have said, Mr. President, fully satisfies
me that you have given to every proposition which has been made
a kind and candid consideration. And you have now expressed the
conclusion to which you have arrived clearly and distinctly. This it
was your right, and, under your oath of office, your duty to do. The
proclamation does not, indeed, mark out the course I would myself
prefer; but I am ready to take it just as it is written and to stand by
it with all my heart. I think, however, the suggestions of Governor
Seward very judicious, and shall be glad to have them adopted.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The President then asked us severally our opinions as to the modifications
proposed, saying that he did not care much about the phrases
he had used. Every one favored the modification, and it was adopted.
Governor Seward then proposed that in the passage relating to colonization
some language should be introduced to show that the colonization
proposed was to be only with the consent of the colonists, and
the consent of the states in which the colonies might be attempted.
This, too, was agreed to, and no other modification was proposed.
Mr. Blair then said that the question having been decided, he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>make no objection to issuing the proclamation; but he would ask
to have his paper, presented some days since, against the policy, filed
with the proclamation. The President consented to this readily. And
then Mr. Blair went on to say that he was afraid of the influence of
the proclamation on the border States and on the army, and stated,
at some length, the grounds of his apprehensions. He disclaimed most
expressly, however, all objections to emancipation <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>, saying he had
always been personally in favor of it—always ready for immediate
emancipation in the midst of slave States, rather than submit to the
perpetuation of the system.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c010'><sup>[279]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The foregoing account from the diary of Secretary Chase
is fully corroborated by a narrative of Mr. Welles describing
the same event.<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c010'><sup>[280]</sup></a> Mr. Blair, as already observed, believed
the time inopportune for issuing the proclamation and feared
as a result that the border States would go over to secession.
The President, however, thought the difficulty not to act as
great as to act. There were two sides, he said, to that
question. For months he had labored to get those States to
move in this matter, convinced in his own mind that it was
their true interest to do so, but his labors were vain. “We
must take the forward movement,” he declared. “They would
acquiesce, if not immediately, soon; for they must be satisfied
that slavery had received its death-blow from slave-owners—it
could not survive the rebellion.”<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c010'><sup>[281]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When the Cabinet had concluded its deliberations the document
was duly attested, the seal affixed and the President’s
signature added. On the following morning, September 23,
1862, the proclamation was published in full by all the leading
newspapers of the loyal States, where it excited the most
profound surprise. Indicating, as it does, the progress of
opinion, it was the first great landmark of the war; behind it
lay the old, before it the new order of things. The successive
steps by which Mr. Lincoln reached this position have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>sketched in the present chapter with fullness and, it is believed,
with accuracy. It has been shown how fugitive slaves
escaping to the Federal lines were at first surrendered to their
masters; how soon afterward, as in the case of General Butler’s
command, they were protected by the army and employed
as laborers; how in a later stage, certain Union commanders
who proposed to confiscate slave property or to arm negroes
as soldiers were gently rebuked and their acts disavowed
by the President. This forbearance, however, was without
effect on the Southern people, whose hatred was quite as likely
to ascribe it to Yankee cowardice as to Yankee magnanimity.</p>

<p class='c000'>With this account of the introduction into the problem of
reconstruction of a novel and very perplexing element we are
prepared to examine the various theories of State status held
by those whose position and ability made them leaders of public
opinion. That subject will be more properly discussed in a
separate chapter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>VI<br /> <span class='large'>THEORIES AND PLANS OF RECONSTRUCTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>In considering the different plans of reconstruction it is
not deemed necessary to discuss further than has been
done in the preceding pages the President’s theory of
State status. There, in his effort to establish loyal governments
in three of the rebellious States, as well as in the
protection and encouragement extended to reorganized Virginia,
we have seen practical applications of that theory. In
his first inaugural Mr. Lincoln said: “It is safe to assert that
no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law
for its own termination,” and on the same occasion he added,
“No State, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of
the Union; that <em>resolves</em> and <em>ordinances</em> to that effect are
legally void.”<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c010'><sup>[282]</sup></a> From the principles of March 4, 1861, was
logically deduced the central idea of the plan announced in December,
1863, and maintained by the President till the last
hour of his life. In his first message to Congress, submitted at
the special session beginning July 4, 1861, he again attempted
to remove the fears of those whose prejudice ascribed to the
dominant political party a purpose to interfere in the domestic
concerns of the slaveholding States. As will be seen by the
following quotation he little more than reiterated on that occasion
what he had solemnly declared four months earlier:</p>

<p class='c013'>Lest there be some uneasiness in the minds of candid men as to
what is to be the course of the Government towards the Southern
States <em>after</em> the rebellion shall have been suppressed, the Executive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>deems it proper to say, it will be his purpose then, as ever, to be guided
by the Constitution and the laws; and that he probably will have no
different understanding of the powers and duties of the Federal Government
relatively to the rights of the States and the people, under the
Constitution, than that expressed in the inaugural address.</p>

<p class='c013'>He desires to preserve the Government, that it may be administered
for all, as it was administered by the men who made it. Loyal citizens
everywhere have the right to claim this of their Government, and the
Government has no right to withhold or neglect it. It is not perceived
that, in giving it, there is any coercion, any conquest, or any
subjugation, in any just sense of those terms.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c010'><sup>[283]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The first paragraph quoted expresses his perfect confidence
in a successful conclusion of the war, and in this respect suggests
the faith of Charles Sumner, in whose private correspondence
the same thought constantly occurs. In his message
the President observed also that Virginia had allowed
“this giant insurrection to make its nest within her borders;
and this Government has no choice left but to deal with it
<em>where</em> it finds it. And it has the less regret, as the loyal
citizens have, in due form, claimed its protection. Those
loyal citizens this Government is bound to recognize, and
protect, as being Virginia.”<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c010'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As early as June, 1861, Mr. Lincoln, on application of
Governor Pierpont, recognized the restored State of Virginia
by promising assistance to repel invasion and to suppress
domestic violence; his example was followed by both Houses
of Congress: first, in the prompt admission of Senators and
Representatives from that Commonwealth, and long afterward,
when there was ample time for reflection, by consenting
to admit the new State of West Virginia, to whose separate
and independent existence the reorganized Legislature had
formally assented. The recognition of Pierpont’s government,
however, involved on the constitutional question little difference
of opinion between the President and Congress. Thus far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>the political departments, if not in complete harmony, were
at any rate not in conflict. This act, though it marked no
distinct Executive policy, was the occasion of some discordant
notes which will be referred to in their proper relation.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may not be unnecessary to observe that underlying the
early policy of the President was a conviction that the rebellion
was effected by a small but treasonable faction; indeed,
in the message of July 4 he expressed his belief that, with
the probable exception of South Carolina, the disloyal were in
a minority in all the seceding States. The great mass of
Southern people, it was assumed, opposed disunion, and with
Federal assistance would soon right themselves. Peaceful
citizens of that section, being regarded as still under protection
of the Constitution, were, therefore, not to be molested.
The conflict waged by the General Government was a personal
war against insurgents. Leaders who encouraged sedition
and committed acts of hostility against the United
States could be tried precisely as in a consolidated state like
Great Britain, and upon conviction punished for their treason.
This attitude was not only wise, but had the additional merit
of greatly simplifying the method of restoration. It asserted
further that the rebellious States were still in the Union,
and under the existing compact could not lawfully withdraw
from it; being in the Union, they were entitled to all the
rights accorded to other members of the confederation. In
brief, its essential idea was the indestructibility of a State,
and it denied that the integrity of the national domain had
been impaired or the number of States diminished by the
ordinances of secession. The General Government could
properly aid the people of a State to express their will, but,
beyond what was demanded by the exigencies of the war,
could not legally exercise those powers constitutionally reserved
to the States. By the treasonable act of levying war
against the Republic the rights and franchises incident to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>United States citizenship were forfeited. The power of Congress
extended no further than to a guaranty of preëxisting
republican forms of government.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the correctness of these principles Democrats and Republicans
alike gave almost universal assent. But the war
was increasing in magnitude, and the measures adequate to
the suppression of a gigantic rebellion proved to be very
different from those adapted to a local insurrection. The
President’s original intention was to overcome armed resistance
to Federal power and as speedily as possible restore the
States to their former relations. This task, however, was
more easily conceived than accomplished, and in the terrible
conflict that ensued political parties as well as individual
statesmen were swept onward from point to point to very
different resting-places. From this condition resulted the
great number of theories of reconstruction presented before
the end of the rebellion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The President early in the war adopted principles that
found little favor with conservative Democrats. His readiness
to recognize the restored State of Virginia was equivalent
to a declaration that if a majority of the people in one of
the seceded States voluntarily transferred their obedience and
support to a hostile power the loyal minority constituted the
State and should govern it. In this connection will be remembered
the objections of Bayard and Saulsbury to receiving
Senators Willey and Carlile from the reorganized government
of Virginia. A further advance is indicated by
Mr. Lincoln’s appointment, early in 1862, of military governors
for those States that had been brought partly within
Federal military lines. After the proclamation of September
22, 1862, and that of January 1 succeeding, the question of
restoration was left permanently out of view. If the erring
States were ever to resume their places they must first recognize
the anti-slavery legislation summarized in the preceding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>chapter. Hitherto the paramount consideration with the
President was a speedy restoration of former relations;
thenceforth “the Union as it was” became impossible, because
slaves liberated in the progress of the war could never
be returned to a condition of servitude. The introduction of
this element greatly increased the difficulties of a problem
already sufficiently intricate. But neither this nor any other
consequence of his proclamation appears to have been overlooked
by the Executive.</p>

<p class='c000'>The message of December 8, 1863, together with the accompanying
proclamation sketched in outline the only plan
which Mr. Lincoln ever published on the subject of reconstruction,
and even to this mode of reinstatement he did not
require exact conformity, recognizing that its modification
might be demanded by inherent differences in situation among
the returning States. By its terms all persons participated
in the rebellion, except certain described classes, were
promised amnesty with restoration of property (excluding
slaves and those cases of property in which rights of third
parties intervened) upon taking an oath which pledged support
of the Constitution and the Union; of the slavery legislation
enacted during the war (unless such acts were repealed
by Congress, or were modified or annulled by the Supreme
Court), and adherence to all Executive proclamations on
that subject so long and so far as not modified or declared
void by the Judiciary. Whenever in any of the rebellious
States a number of persons equal to one tenth of the voters
participating in the Presidential election of 1860, who were
qualified electors under the laws existing immediately before
the ordinance of secession, should reëstablish a State government
republican in form, and not contravening this oath,
it would be recognized as the true government of that State
and should receive the benefits of the constitutional guaranty.
To the emancipated race renewed assurance of permanent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>freedom was given. It was also suggested that in reorganization
the political framework of the States be maintained.
The admission of members elected to Congress was a matter
for the determination of its respective Houses.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is proper to notice in this method of reorganization,
known afterward as “the Louisiana Plan,” the absence of
any provision for conferring on the freedmen the elective
franchise. In a private letter to Governor Hahn the President
had, it is true, expressed his personal preference for
including among the electors such of the colored race as had
fought gallantly in the Union ranks and also the very intelligent
among them<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c010'><sup>[285]</sup></a>. This, however, was only an unofficial
suggestion. Nor were securities of any sort required for the
future as a condition of reinstatement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under this plan, which was presented as only a rallying
point, Union governments had been inaugurated in Tennessee,
Louisiana and Arkansas; the first two participated in the
Presidential election of 1864, and before the close of the war
they had all elected members to Congress. The legality of
these governments Mr. Lincoln always maintained. How
Congress regarded them will be related in succeeding chapters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Long before the announcement of any mode of reorganization
by the Executive, members of the Legislative branch of
Government had made some efforts in this field; these, however,
were for the most part tentative and hesitant. The
question had not yet been brought fairly before Congress;
indeed, it was in discussing the results and tendencies of
Presidential reconstruction that the Congressional plan, destined
ultimately to prevail, slowly assumed definitive form.</p>

<p class='c000'>As early as December, 1861, Mr. Harlan, of Iowa, introduced
into the Senate a bill for the establishment of provisional
governments for the territory embraced by the States
of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>and Tennessee. It was referred to the Committee on
Territories, but was never reported.</p>

<p class='c000'>More important, however, than this proposed enactment,
both because of the acknowledged position of their author
and the influence which they exerted upon the mode of reconstruction
finally adopted, were the nine resolutions offered,
February 11, 1862, by Charles Sumner. These were “declaratory
of the relations between the United States and the
territory once occupied by certain States, and now usurped
by pretended governments, without constitutional or legal
right.” A preamble in the characteristic style of this celebrated
statesman introduced his famous propositions, which
were as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>Whereas certain States, rightfully belonging to the Union of the
United States, have through their respective governments wickedly
undertaken to abjure all those duties by which their connection with the
Union was maintained; to renounce all allegiance to the Constitution;
to levy war upon the national Government; and, for the consummation
of this treason, have unconstitutionally and unlawfully confederated
together, with the declared purpose of putting an end by force to the
supremacy of the Constitution within their respective limits; and
whereas this condition of insurrection, organized by pretended governments,
openly exists in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Virginia, except
in Eastern Tennessee and Western Virginia, and has been declared by
the President of the United States, in a proclamation duly made in
conformity with an act of Congress, to exist throughout this territory,
with the exceptions already named; and whereas the extensive territory
thus usurped by these pretended governments and organized into a
hostile confederation, belongs to the United States, as an inseparable
part thereof, under the sanctions of the Constitution, to be held in trust
for the inhabitants in the present and future generations, and is so
completely interlinked with the Union that it is forever dependent
thereupon; and whereas the Constitution, which is the supreme law
of the land, cannot be displaced in its rightful operation within this
territory, but must ever continue the supreme law thereof, notwithstanding
the doings of any pretended governments acting singly or in
confederation, in order to put an end to its supremacy: Therefore:</p>

<p class='c013'>1. <em>Resolved</em>, That any vote of secession or other act by which any
State may undertake to put an end to the supremacy of the Constitution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>within its territory is inoperative and void against the Constitution,
and when sustained by force it becomes a practical <em>abdication</em> by the
State of all rights under the Constitution, while the treason which it
involves still further works an instant <em>forfeiture</em> of all those functions
and powers essential to the continued existence of the State as a body
politic, so that from that time forward the territory falls under the
exclusive jurisdiction of Congress as other territory, and the State
being, according to the language of the law, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo-de-se</span></i>, ceases to exist.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. That any combination of men assuming to act in the place of such
State, attempting to insnare or coerce the inhabitants thereof into a
confederation hostile to the Union, is rebellious, treasonable, and destitute
of all moral authority; and that such combination is a usurpation
incapable of any constitutional existence and utterly lawless, so that
everything dependent upon it is without constitutional or legal support.</p>

<p class='c013'>3. That the termination of a State under the Constitution necessarily
causes the termination of those peculiar local institutions which,
having no origin in the Constitution or in those natural rights which
exist independent of the Constitution, are upheld by the sole and
exclusive authority of the State.</p>

<p class='c013'>4. That slavery, being a peculiar local institution, derived from local
laws, without any origin in the Constitution or in natural rights, is
upheld by the sole and exclusive authority of the State, and must
therefore cease to exist legally or constitutionally when the State
on which it depends no longer exists; for the incident cannot survive
the principal.</p>

<p class='c013'>5. That in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction over the territory
once occupied by the States, it is the duty of Congress to see that the
supremacy of the Constitution is maintained in its essential principles,
so that everywhere in this extensive territory slavery shall cease to
exist practically, as it has already ceased to exist constitutionally or
legally.</p>

<p class='c013'>6. That any recognition of slavery in such territory, or any surrender
of slaves under the pretended laws of the extinct States by any officer
of the United States, civil or military, is a recognition of the pretended
governments, to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of Congress
under the Constitution, and is in the nature of aid and comfort to the
rebellion that has been organized.</p>

<p class='c013'>7. That any such recognition of slavery or surrender of pretended
slaves, besides being a recognition of the pretended governments, giving
them aid and comfort, is a denial of the rights of persons who, by the
extinction of the States, have become free, so that, under the Constitution,
they cannot again be enslaved.</p>

<p class='c013'>8. That allegiance from the inhabitant and protection from the Government
are corresponding obligations, dependent upon each other,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>so that while the allegiance of every inhabitant of this territory, without
distinction of color or class, is due to the United States, and cannot
in any way be defeated by the action of any pretended Government, or
by any pretence of property or claim to service, the corresponding
obligation of protection is at the same time due by the United States
to every such inhabitant, without distinction of color or class; and it
follows that inhabitants held as slaves, whose paramount allegiance
is due to the United States, may justly look to the national Government
for protection.</p>

<p class='c013'>9. That the duty directly cast upon Congress by the extinction of the
States is reinforced by the positive prohibition of the Constitution that
“no State shall enter into any Confederation,” or “without the consent
of Congress keep troops or ships-of-war in time of peace, or enter
into any agreement or compact with another State,” or “grant letters
of marque and reprisal,” or “coin money,” or “emit bills of credit,”
or “without the consent of Congress lay any duties on imports or
exports,” all of which have been done by these pretended Governments,
and also by the positive injunction of the Constitution, addressed
to the nation, that “the United States shall guaranty to every State
in this Union a republican form of government,” and that in pursuance of
this duty cast upon Congress, and further enjoined by the Constitution,
Congress will assume complete jurisdiction of such vacated territory
where such unconstitutional and illegal things have been attempted,
and will proceed to establish therein republican forms of government
under the Constitution; and in the execution of this trust will provide
carefully for the protection of all the inhabitants thereof; for the
security of families, the organization of labor, the encouragement of
industry, and the welfare of society, and will in every way discharge the
duties of a just, merciful and paternal Government.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c010'><sup>[286]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Sumner, as already noticed, having confidence in the ultimate
triumph of the national cause, began early in the
war to reflect on the subject of reorganization. As might
have been expected from his previous career, his opinion
of the changes that would result from rebellion inclined
him at the outset to adopt the views of the less extreme anti-slavery
men. Notwithstanding this fact, however, his scheme
of reconstruction, because of its radical and comprehensive
character, caused something of a sensation when introduced
in the Senate, and disturbed the repose of many conservative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>patriots outside. By leading Republicans it was promptly
disavowed as the policy of their party. These resolutions,
though never adopted or even formally discussed by Congress,
colored somewhat the final work of reconstruction. An account
of the extent and the manner in which they influenced
the legislative plan belongs properly to a consideration of the
acts of March, 1867. What appeared to be a public necessity
had by that time brought many members of his party
fully abreast of Mr. Sumner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The interval had been employed in various ways to keep
his peculiar theory before the public. A private letter to
Francis Lieber, dated March 29, 1862, shows that Sumner’s
view of the measures essential to restoration had not been
modified by the discussions of a month. “Assuming,” he says,
“that our military success is complete, and that the rebel
armies are scattered, what next? Unless I am mistaken, the
most difficult thing of all,—namely, the reorganization. How
shall it be done,—by what process? What power shall set
a-going the old governments? Will the people coöperate
enough to constitute self-government? I have positive opinions
here. If successful in war, we shall have then before us
the alternative: (1) Separation; or (2) subjugation of these
States with emancipation. I do not see any escape. Diplomatists
here and abroad think it will be separation. I think
the latter, under my resolutions or something like.”<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c010'><sup>[287]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>By a distinguished Confederate officer Sumner has been
described as a statesman who seemed over-educated, and who
had retained without having digested his learning;<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c010'><sup>[288]</sup></a> by an admirer
of his own party as wanting in tact and practical wisdom
as a legislator.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c010'><sup>[289]</sup></a> Though it must be admitted that a grain of
truth forms the basis of these criticisms, yet the letter to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>friend Dr. Lieber shows no lack of insight into the events and
tendencies of the times. Without anticipating a subsequent
portion of this narrative it may be observed here that if his
vision did not pierce the remote future, his knowledge and experience
enabled him to see as much of coming events as the
most gifted of his contemporaries. Writing a year later, July
21, 1863, to Hon. John Bright, one of our few friends in England,
he remarked that “so great a revolution cannot come to a
close at once.”<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c010'><sup>[290]</sup></a> The defeat of General Lee at Gettysburg a
few weeks earlier suggested the thought that the destruction of
the Army of Northern Virginia would have precipitated on
Congress the entire question of reconstruction, and time was
an essential element in the development of Sumner’s most
cherished plans.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not only in his private correspondence and in the discussion
of every conceivable measure before Congress did he endeavor
to enforce his theory of State status, but he also published
in a leading periodical an elaboration and defence of his
opinions. For many reasons the undelivered speech forming
the basis of his article in the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite> for October,
1863, is of remarkable interest. It reveals the mental habits
of one of the most useful and influential characters then in
public life; the statesman is really thinking aloud. He appears,
for instance, to have been much impressed by the fact
that, under the Commonwealth, Cromwell partitioned his
country into military districts of which Sumner remarked that
there were precisely <em>eleven</em>, just the number of States in
rebellion. One view is enforced by an appropriate passage
from Cicero, while of Edmund Burke it is asserted that had
he lived during the Civil War his eloquence would have
blasted Southern leaders for their folly and madness in entering
upon a career of rebellion. All who are familiar with
the debates of that period must have observed that Sumner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>was considerably influenced by the authority of great names,
and in consequence sometimes exposed himself to rebuke from
men who, though in many respects inferior, had studied the
questions of the day in the light of their own times.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not intended, however, to trace the origin of the doctrine
of State suicide or even to suggest all the arguments
upon which he relied for its support, the purpose of these remarks
being rather to show on what principles its essential
propositions were based. This, it is believed, cannot be better
done than by explaining the resolutions in his own language.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite> he wrote: “It is sometimes said
that the States themselves committed <em>suicide</em>, so that as States
they ceased to exist, leaving their whole jurisdiction open to
the occupation of the United States under the Constitution.
This assumption is founded on the fact that, whatever may
be the existing governments in these States, they are in no
respect constitutional, and since the State itself is known
by the government, with which its life is intertwined, it must
cease to exist constitutionally when its government no longer
exists constitutionally.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He acknowledges the difficulty of defining the entity which
we call a State. “Among us,” says Mr. Sumner, “the term
is most known as the technical name for one of the political
societies which compose our Union.... Nobody has
suggested, I presume, that any ‘State’ of our Union has,
through rebellion, ceased to exist as a <em>civil society</em>, or even
as a <em>political community</em>. It is only as a <em>State of the Union</em>,
armed with State rights, or at least as a <em>local government</em>,
which annually renews itself, as the snake its skin, that it
can be called in question. But it is vain to challenge for the
technical ‘State,’ or for the annual government, that immortality
which belongs to civil society. The one is an
artificial body, the other is a natural body; and while the
first, overwhelmed by insurrection or war, may change or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>die, the latter can change or die only with the extinction of
the community itself, whatever may be its name or its
form.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Phillimore is quoted in support of the proposition that a
“State,” even in a broader signification, may lose its life.
That author says: “A state, like an individual, may die,”
and, among the various ways in which this may occur, adds,
“by its submission and the donation of itself to another
country.” “But in the case of our Rebel States,” resumes
Mr. Sumner, “there has been a plain submission and donation
of themselves,—<em>effective, at least, to break the continuity of
government</em>, if not to destroy that immortality which has
been claimed. Nor can it make any difference, in breaking
this continuity, that the submission and donation, constituting
a species of attornment, were to enemies at home rather than
to enemies abroad,—to Jefferson Davis rather than to Louis
Napoleon. The thread is snapped in one case as much as in
the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But a <em>change of form</em> in the actual government may be
equally effective. Cicero speaks of a change so complete as
‘to leave no image of a state behind.’ But this is precisely
what has been done throughout the whole Rebel region:
there is no image of a <em>constitutional</em> State left behind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The first resolution of the series quoted declares “That
any vote of secession or other act by which any State may
undertake to put an end to the supremacy of the Constitution
within its territory is inoperative and void against the Constitution,
and when sustained by force it becomes a practical
<em>abdication</em> by the State of all its rights under the Constitution.”
Perhaps Mr. Sumner in the essay failed to strengthen his
original statement of this proposition, which he believed was
“upheld by the historic example of England, at the Revolution
of 1688, when, on the flight of James II. and the abandonment
of his kingly duties, the two Houses of Parliament
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>voted that the monarch, ‘having violated the fundamental
laws, and having withdrawn himself out of the kingdom, <em>had
abdicated the government</em>, and that the throne had thereby become
vacant.’” This precedent, which Senator Sumner
thought applicable, was by no means so formidable an argument
against the rebellious States as he chose to regard it. If
the term <em>abdicate</em> is equivalent to a species of informal resignation
it did not apply strictly to the case of James II., for that
unfortunate ruler presented to Englishmen the unusual spectacle
of withdrawing from his kingdom under an escort of
Dutch troops. Doubtless he remembered the saying of his
father, who proved the truth of the adage in his own person,
that the distance is short between the prison and the grave
of a king. The expectation of recovering his throne was a
motive with James scarcely less powerful than that of taking
precaution for his personal safety. This intention appears
from the unsuccessful campaign in Ireland, which he had
selected as a rallying point. That monarch’s real offence was
his violation of the laws of England. Many of his predecessors,
as well as some of his successors, were as unreasonable
and as obstinate as he. The charge of abdication was
scarcely a decent pretext for declaring the throne vacant, and
Mr. Sumner appears to have forgotten for the moment that
the Federal Government is one of limited while Parliament
is clothed with absolute powers. In reality James was coerced
by the Prince of Orange into “withdrawing” from the
Kingdom. It is not intended here to call in question the
accepted vindication of the Revolution of 1688, but merely to
show that the Massachusetts statesman was at times not
above supporting an argument by a legal or an historical
fiction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same resolution continues: “The treason which it
[the attempt by force to terminate the supremacy of the
Constitution] involves still further works an instant <em>forfeiture</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>of all those functions and powers essential to the
continued existence of the State as a body politic.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the idea of State forfeiture his reasoning is entitled
to more respect. He argues: “But again it is sometimes
said that the States, by their flagrant treason, have <em>forfeited</em>
their rights as States, so as to be civilly dead. It is a patent
and indisputable fact, that this gigantic treason was inaugurated
with all the forms of law known to the State; that it
was carried forward not only by individuals, but also by
States, so far as States can perpetrate treason; that the States
pretended to withdraw bodily in their corporate capacities;—that
the Rebellion, as it showed itself, was <em>by</em> States as well
as <em>in</em> States; that it was by the governments of States as
well as by the people of States; and that, to the common
observer, the crime was consummated by the several corporations
as well as by the individuals of whom they were composed.
From this fact, obvious to all, it is argued that,
since, according to Blackstone, ‘a traitor hath abandoned his
connection with society, and hath no longer any right to the
advantages which before belonged to him purely as a member
of the community,’ by the same principle the traitor State
is no longer to be regarded as a member of the Union. But
it is not necessary, on the present occasion, to insist on the
application of any such principle to States.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Discarding as not essential to his defence the theories of
State forfeiture, State abdication, or even State suicide, the
article adds: “It is enough, that, for the time being, and
<em>in the absence of a loyal government</em>, they can take no part
and perform no function in the Union, <em>so that they cannot be
recognized by the National Government</em>. The reason is plain.
There are in these States no local functionaries bound by
constitutional oaths, so that, in fact, there are no constitutional
functionaries; and since the State government is necessarily
composed of such functionaries, there can be no State
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>government. Thus, for instance, in South Carolina, Pickens
and his associates may call themselves the governor and
legislature; and in Virginia, Letcher and his associates may
call themselves governor and legislature; but we cannot recognize
them as such. Therefore to all pretensions in behalf of
State governments in the Rebel States I oppose the simple
FACT, that for the time being no such governments exist.
The broad spaces once occupied by those governments are
now abandoned and vacated.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Discussing the question of transition to rightful government
he says: “And here the question occurs, How shall this
rightful jurisdiction be established in the vacated States?
Some there are, so impassioned for State rights, and so anxious
for forms even at the expense of substance, that they
insist upon the instant restoration of the old State governments
in all their parts, through the agency of loyal citizens,
who meanwhile must be protected in this work of restoration.
But assuming that all this is practicable, as it clearly is not,
it attributes to the loyal citizens of a Rebel State, however
few in numbers,—it may be an insignificant minority,—a
power clearly inconsistent with the received principle of popular
government, that the majority must rule, ... but
the argument for State Rights assumes that all these rights
may be lodged in voters as few in number as ever controlled
a rotten borough of England.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pray admitting that a minority may organize the new
government, how shall it be done? and by whom shall it be
set in motion?... It is not easy to see how the
new government can be set in motion without a resort to
some revolutionary proceeding, instituted either by the citizens
or by the military power,—unless Congress, in the exercise
of its plenary powers, should undertake to organize the
new jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But every revolutionary proceeding is to be avoided. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>will be within the recollection of all familiar with our history,
that our fathers, while regulating the separation of the
Colonies from the parent country, were careful that all should
be done according to the forms of law, so that the thread
of <em>legality</em> should continue unbroken. To this end the Continental
Congress interfered by a supervising direction. But
the Tory argument in that day denied the power of Congress
as earnestly as it denies this power now.”...</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, happily,” he says, “we are not constrained to any
such revolutionary proceeding. The new governments can
all be organized by Congress, which is the natural guardian
of people without any immediate government, and within the
jurisdiction of the Constitution of the United States. Indeed,
with the State governments already <em>vacated</em> by rebellion, the
Constitution becomes, for the time, the supreme and only
law, binding alike on President and Congress, so that neither
can establish any law or institution incompatible with it.
And the whole Rebel region, deprived of all local government,
lapses under the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress,
precisely as any other territory; or, in other words, the lifting
of the local governments leaves the whole vast region
without any other government than Congress, unless the
President should undertake to govern it by military
power.”...</p>

<p class='c000'>This part of the essay concludes with a declaration that
its author had no pride of opinion, but would cheerfully abandon
his views when convinced of their error. He next
proceeds to an examination of the sources of Congressional
power. These, he asserts, are derived from the necessity of
the case, for Congress must have jurisdiction over every portion
of the United States <em>where there is no other government</em>;
and from the <em>Rights of War</em>, which he deemed not less abundant
for Congress than for the President. “It is Congress,”
he contended, “that conquers; and the same authority that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>conquers must govern.” A third source of authority, common
alike to Congress and the President, was the constitutional
provision imposing on the United States the duty of
guarantying republican forms of government. These ample
powers were confirmed by an additional grant in the clause
concerning the admission of new States “into this Union.”
The latter left it with Congress to prescribe the time and
manner of the return of the rebel States, assuming that they
were no longer <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i> States of the Union.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the “unanswerable reasons for Congressional
governments” the article says: “Slavery is so odious that it
can exist only by virtue of positive law, plain and unequivocal;
but no such words can be found in the Constitution. Therefore
Slavery is impossible within the exclusive jurisdiction
of the National Government.... I am glad to believe
that it is implied, if not expressed, in the Chicago Platform;
... but if the rebel territory falls under the exclusive
jurisdiction of the National Government, then Slavery will
be impossible there.... The moment that the States
fell, Slavery fell also; so that, even without any Proclamation
of the President, Slavery had ceased to have
a legal and constitutional existence in every rebel
State.”<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c010'><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“Let it be established in advance,” declared Mr. Sumner,
“as an inseparable incident to every Act of Secession, that
it is not only impotent against the Constitution of the United
States, but that, on its occurrence, both soil and inhabitants
will lapse beneath the jurisdiction of Congress, and no State
will ever again pretend to secede.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The argument of which an epitome has been given was
regarded by the Postmaster-General, Montgomery Blair, as
formidable enough to merit attention, and he accordingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>replied in a speech at Rockville, Maryland, in which Sumner,
for arraying himself directly against the President on a question
of fundamental policy in the conduct of the war, was
mentioned with sharp censure. This brought upon the Cabinet
member, and upon Mr. Lincoln over his shoulders, much
vehement criticism. It was in relation to this address that
the President said:</p>

<p class='c013'>The controversy between the two sets of men represented by Blair
and by Sumner is one of mere form and little else. I do not think Mr.
Blair would agree that the States in rebellion are to be permitted to
come at once into the political family and renew their performances,
which have already so bedeviled us, and I do not think Mr. Sumner
would insist that when the loyal people of a State obtain supremacy
in their councils and are ready to assume the direction of their own
affairs they should be excluded. I do not understand Mr. Blair to
admit that Jefferson Davis may take his seat in Congress again as a
representative of his people. I do not understand Mr. Sumner to
assert that John Minor Botts may not. So far as I understand Mr.
Sumner, he seems in favor of Congress taking from the Executive the
power it at present exercises over insurrectionary districts and assuming
it to itself; but when the vital question arises as to the right and privilege
of the people of these States to govern themselves, I apprehend
there will be little difference among loyal men. The question at once
is presented, In whom is this power vested? and the practical matter
for discussion is how to keep the rebellious population from overwhelming
and outvoting the loyal minority.<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c010'><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Concisely expressed, the theory of State suicide based reconstruction
upon the right of Congress to legislate for
Federal territories and to admit new States into this Union.
In one view it rested on a provision in the Constitution which
makes it obligatory on the States to have republican governments.
This side of the doctrine shaded into the conservative
view, according to which it is the duty of the States
to be represented in Congress; but Sumner, as will subsequently
appear, maintained that the Confederate States should
not be counted when numbers were to be estimated in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>adoption of constitutional amendments; also that Congress
had power to prescribe the qualifications of voters for conventions
in those States. This view regarded the war as a
conflict of ideas; it assumed to find authority in the individual
conscience discerning the will of God, was inclined to
disallow objective standards, and to consider all law as matter
of subjective determination. From a careful perusal of his
speeches Mr. Sumner appears to have insisted that a republican
form of government could be such a one only as conformed
to his subjective ideas. Except his own State, whose
constitution of 1780 was held to have abolished slavery in
that Commonwealth, no one of the States in 1789 possessed,
according to his notions, a republican form of government.
His touchstone of republicanism was the Declaration of Independence.
In short, the requirements of the Constitution
appear to have been found, not in the written instrument,
but in his individual conceptions of political justice, equality
and liberty whereby he constituted himself a new source of
law. In the matter of a subjective standard of natural justice
and the like, the “radicals” generally agreed with Sumner.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c010'><sup>[293]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The position that the object of the war from the beginning,
on the part of the Federal authorities, was to fulfill the guaranty
of a republican form of government is untenable. It
may well be doubted whether the community so guaranteed
can be restricted to any particular government; indeed,
it is difficult to see how a government not voluntarily instituted
by the people of a State can be called republican.
By having a government imposed by Congress they would
resemble the people of a Territory, and the result would be
an inequality among the States composing the Union.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Though it has been commended as well written, there is
some crude thinking and even cruder phraseology in the preamble
as well as in the resolutions themselves. Mr. Sumner
appears to have been much influenced by feudal and other historical
analogies. It will be seen later how he recoiled somewhat
from accepting fully the consequences of his own principles.<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c010'><sup>[294]</sup></a>
The famous theory of State suicide, as tersely stated
by an able advocate of the doctrine, was in effect that “a
Territory by coming into the Union becomes a State; a State
by going out of the Union becomes a Territory.”<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c010'><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>To offset the resolutions of Sumner, Hon. Garrett Davis,
of Kentucky, introduced two days later a series of eight propositions.
Of these the first asserts that the rights, privileges
and liberties which the Constitution assures to the
people of the United States “are fixed, permanent, and immutable
through all the phases of peace and war, until changed
by the power and in the mode prescribed by the Constitution
itself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the light of subsequent events, however, the last is the
most interesting of the series. This declares “That the
United States Government should march their armies into
all the insurgent States, and promptly put down the military
power which they have arrayed against it, and give protection
and security to the loyal men thereof, to enable them
to reconstruct their legitimate State governments, and bring
them and the people back to the Union and to obedience and
duty under the Constitution and the laws of the United
States, bearing the sword in one hand and the olive branch
in the other, and whilst inflicting on the guilty leaders condign
and exemplary punishment, granting amnesty and oblivion
to the comparatively innocent masses; and if the people
of any State cannot, or will not reconstruct their State government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and return to loyalty and duty, Congress should
provide a government for such State as a Territory of the
United States, securing to the people thereof their appropriate
constitutional rights.”<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c010'><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>These propositions, like the resolutions of Sumner, were
never taken up for discussion, and they are referred to as
containing a clear expression, by a Southern Democrat,<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c010'><sup>[297]</sup></a> of
extra-constitutional powers in treating incorrigible States as
Territories.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sumner was not alone in maintaining novel opinions concerning
the relation of the seceded States to the Federal Government.
A theory destined to exert even greater influence in
shaping the plan of reconstruction finally adopted was announced
at the very commencement of hostilities by Thaddeus
Stevens, of Pennsylvania, then one of the foremost members
of the Republican party and a few years later its acknowledged
leader in the House. Unlike the Massachusetts Senator,
Mr. Stevens never formulated his views of State status;
but as he urged them on almost every conceivable occasion
the essential principles of his system may be easily collected
from his numerous speeches in Congress. Subjects of legislation
only remotely related to his favorite topic appear to have
been regarded by him as important chiefly because of the
opportunity afforded to express his sentiments on the measures
necessary to reorganization. These opinions, he declared,
had been deliberately formed; we know that to the
end they were persistently urged and ably defended. Because
of their radical nature and the frequency with which they
were reiterated Stevens was by many regarded as a sort of
fanatic; this estimate was confirmed, no doubt, by his bodily
deformity as well as by an apparent want of amiability and
a certain bluntness of expression. Even by keen observers he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>was at first considered a man of mediocre ability. But, though
not to be compared with the giant race of an earlier generation,
he was a statesman far above the common-place. Among the
multitude of plans and theories offered in Congress his system
was distinguished for the harmony of its parts; and enemies
who hated, no less than followers who feared, him were
forced to admit the consistency of his principles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The limitations of Stevens in the field of constructive
statesmanship cannot now be discussed; for their consideration
belongs properly to an examination of the first reconstruction
act, which was no more than a modification of his theory.
Long before Sumner’s plan had agitated timid conservatives
the Pennsylvanian leader by his extreme opinions had astonished
Congress. When the question of discharging from
labor or service those slaves employed in hostility to the
United States came before the House at the special session
beginning July 4, 1861, Stevens said:</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Speaker, I thought the time had come when the laws of war
were to govern our action; when constitutions, if they stood in the way
of the laws of war in dealing with the enemy, had no right to intervene.
Who pleads the Constitution against our proposed action?
Who says the Constitution must come in, in bar of our action? It is the
advocates of rebels, of rebels who have sought to overthrow the Constitution
and trample it in the dust—who repudiate the Constitution.
Sir, these rebels, who have disregarded and set at defiance that instrument,
are, by every rule of municipal and international law, estopped
from pleading it against our action. Who, then, is it that comes to
us and says, “You cannot do this thing, because your Constitution does
not permit it?” The Constitution! Our Constitution, which you repudiate
and trample under foot, forbids it! Sir, it is an absurdity.
There must be a party in court to plead it, and that party, to be
entitled to plead it in court, must first acknowledge its supremacy, or
he has no business to be in court at all. I repeat, then, that those who
bring in this plea here, in bar of our action, are the advocates of rebels.
They are nothing else, whatever they intend. I mean it, of course, in
a legal sense. I mean they are acting in the capacity of counsellors-at-law
for the rebels; they are speaking for them, and not for us—who
are the plaintiffs in this transaction. I deny that they have any right to
plead at all. I deny that they have any standing in court. I deny that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>they have any right to invoke this Constitution, which they deny has
authority over them, which they set at defiance and trample under foot.
I deny that they can be permitted to come here and tell us we must be
loyal to the Constitution.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c010'><sup>[298]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The expectation almost universally cherished at this time
was that when the insurrection should have been suppressed,
as it was confidently believed it speedily would be, the erring
States, without the interposition of Federal authority, would
resume their normal relations to the General Government.
With this state of public opinion in mind it will readily be
perceived how great an interval separated Mr. Stevens from
both parties in Congress. The opening sentence of the remarks
quoted contains the essential idea of his theory of the
change resulting from rebellion. Armed secession had unlocked
the war powers, and the Constitution, where it conflicted
with these powers, had ceased to be a restraint upon
government. The military had risen superior to the civil
authority. The principle was boldly and emphatically announced
that those who repudiated and defied the supreme
law could not at the same time plead its provisions.</p>

<p class='c000'>On January 8, 1863, the appropriation bill being under
consideration, an amendment was offered to add to the clause
“for compensation of thirty-three commissioners, at $3,000
each, and eleven clerks, at $1,200 each, $112,200,” the following:</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Provided</em>, A sufficient sum shall be collected in the insurrectionary
States to pay said salaries: <em>And provided further</em>, That no greater sum
shall at any time be paid to said commissioners, or to any of them,
than shall have been collected from the taxes in the insurrectionary
States, and paid into the Treasury of the United States.<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c010'><sup>[299]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The discussion which ensued brought out an expression of
views relative to the position of the seceded States under the
Federal Government. Stevens in the course of his remarks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>said: “I did say, sir, that I find no warrant in the Constitution
for the admission, under the Constitution, of West Virginia.
I do not know whether the gentleman from Kentucky
voted for that bill or not.” Mr. Dunlap, the member referred
to, stated that he had voted against the bill, because he deemed
it unconstitutional. After this explanation the Pennsylvania
leader proceeded as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the gentleman voted against it upon the same opinion I expressed,
that it was unconstitutional. But I went further and voted for it
because I did not believe that the Constitution embraced a State now
in arms against the Government of this Union and I hold that doctrine
now. It was not said upon the spur of the occasion. It is a deliberate
opinion, formed upon a careful examination of the law of the United
States and the laws of nations.</p>

<p class='c013'>Though it may be out of place just now, I will give one or two
reasons for my opinion. The establishment of our blockade admitted
the Southern States, the Confederates, to be a belligerent power. Foreign
nations have all admitted them as a belligerent power. Whenever that
came to be admitted by us and by foreign nations, it placed the rebellious
States precisely in the condition of an alien enemy with regard
to duties and obligations. Now, I think there is nothing more plainly
written in the law of nations than that whenever a war, which is
admitted to be a national war, springs up between nation and nation,
ally and ally, confederate and confederate, every obligation which previously
existed between them, whether treaty, compact, contract, or
anything else, is wholly abrogated, and from that moment the belligerents
act toward each other, not according to any municipal obligations,
not according to any compacts or treaties, but simply according
to the laws of war. And I hold and maintain that with regard to all
the Southern States in rebellion. I do not speak of Kentucky, but of
those States which have gone out under an act of legislation or convention—the
Constitution has no binding influence and no application.</p>

<p class='c000'>In answer to a question by Representative Dunlap he stated
further that the seceded States, in his opinion, were not
members of the Union. “The ordinances of secession,” he
added, “backed by the armed power which made them a
belligerent nation, did take them, so far as present operations
are concerned, from under the laws of the nation.” When
asked how, as Chairman of the Committee of Ways and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Means, he proposed to pass an appropriation to pay officers
to collect revenue in States which did not belong to the
Union, he said:</p>

<p class='c013'>I propose to levy that tax, and collect it as a war measure. I would
levy a tax wherever I can upon these conquered provinces, just as all
nations levy them upon provinces and nations they conquer. If my
views and principles are right, I would not only collect that tax, but I
would, as a necessary war measure, take every particle of property, real
and personal, life estate and reversion, of every disloyal man, and sell
it for the benefit of the nation in carrying on this war. We have such
power and we are to treat them simply as provinces to be conquered,
and as a nation fighting in hostility to us until we do conquer them.
To me it is a great absurdity to say that men, by millions, in arms, shall
claim the protection of the provisions of the Constitution and laws made
for loyal men, while they do not obey one of those laws, but repudiate
their binding effect. There never was a principle more clear than that
every obligation, whether in a national or civil point of view, in order to
be binding, must be reciprocal; and that the moment the duty ceases
upon the one part, the obligation ceases upon the other; and that, in my
judgment, is precisely the condition of the rebel States now.</p>

<p class='c000'>The secession ordinance of South Carolina he characterized
in response to an inquiry as an act of treason and rebellion,
and when asked whether the backing up of these ordinances
by armed force imparted to them any validity, he replied:
“I hold that so long as they remain in force against us as a
belligerent power, and until they are conquered, it is in fact
an existing operation. I will not say anything about its
legality. [Laughter.] I hold that it is an existing <em>fact</em>,
and that so far from enforcing any laws, you have not the
power.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To Mr. Yeaman, who asked whether those people were then
citizens of the United States, or whether they formed an independent
nation, and if the latter whence was derived the
right or the authority to wage war against them, and to tax
them for the support of that war, Stevens answered: “I hold
that the Constitution, in the first place, so far operated that
when they went into secession and armed rebellion they committed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>treason; and that when they so combined themselves
as to make themselves admitted as belligerents—not merely
as men in insurrection, but as belligerents—they did acquire
the right to be treated as prisoners of war, and all the other
rights which pertain to belligerents under the laws of nations.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Some members held in utter abhorrence the principles of
the Pennsylvania leader; others were astonished at their
boldness. It was in the course of this discussion, participated
in by many Representatives, that Stevens defined his existing
as well as his past relations to his party, and referred, not
without a touch of pride, to the fact that hitherto he had
pointed out the way for the Republican majority—in short,
that he had been the political prophet of his party. He
declared:</p>

<p class='c013'>I know perfectly well, as I said before, I do not speak the sentiments
of this side of the House as a party. I know more than that: that for
the last fifteen years I have always been a step ahead of the party I
have acted with in these matters; but I have never been so far ahead
with the exception of the principles I now enunciate, but that the
members of the party have overtaken me and gone ahead; and they,
together with the gentleman from New York, [Mr. Olin] will again
overtake me and go with me, before this infamous and bloody rebellion
is ended. They will find that they cannot execute the Constitution in the
seceding States; that it is a total nullity there; and that this war must
be carried on upon principles wholly independent of it. They will come
to the conclusion that the adoption of the measures I advocated at the
outset of the war, the arming of the negroes, the slaves of the rebels,
is the only way left on earth in which these rebels can be exterminated.
They will find that they must treat those States now outside of the
Union as conquered provinces and settle them with new men, and drive
the present rebels as exiles from this country; for I tell you they have
the pluck and endurance for which I gave them credit a year and a
half ago in a speech which I made, but which was not relished on this
side of the House, nor by the people in the free States. They have such
determination, energy, and endurance, that nothing but actual extermination
or exile or starvation will ever induce them to surrender to this
Government. I do not ask gentlemen to indorse my views, nor do I
speak for anybody but myself; but in order that I may have some
credit for sagacity, I ask that gentlemen will write this down in their
memories. It will not be two years before they will call it up, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>before they will adopt my views, or adopt the other alternative of a
disgraceful submission by this side of the country.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c010'><sup>[300]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>For himself, for the Administration and for the Republican
party even so radical an anti-slavery man as Owen Lovejoy
made haste to repudiate these extreme opinions.</p>

<p class='c000'>In debate, January 22, 1864, Stevens enunciated still
more clearly the fundamental principles of his system. “I
mean to say,” he declared on that occasion, “that if a State,
as a State, makes war upon the Government and becomes a
belligerent power, we treat it as a foreign nation, and when
we conquer it we treat it just as we do any other foreign
nation.” “There can be no neutrals,” he added, “in a hostile
State.” If loyal people domiciled in the South desired to
avoid punishment or the hardships of public enemies, they
should change their place of residence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Relative to discerning the State in the Union minority
he observed: “If ten men fit to save Sodom can elect a
Governor and other State officers for and against the eleven
hundred thousand Sodomites in Virginia, then the democratic
doctrine that the majority shall rule is discarded and dangerously
ignored. When the doctrine that the <em>quality</em> and
not the <em>number</em> of voters is to decide the right to govern, then
we are no longer a republic, but the worst form of despotism.”
It was a mere mockery, he affirmed, to say that a tithe of
the residents, because they were holier or more loyal than
others, could change the form and administer the government
of an organized State. The people who took a State out of
the Union were subject to the laws of the commonwealth,
and, so far as the General Government is concerned, subject
to the laws of war and of nations, both while the war
continued and when it ended.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c010'><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Northern Democrats, from the beginning to the end of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>reconstruction, were consistent advocates of a doctrine which
involved no contradictions like the system of Sumner and no
element of vindictiveness like the “conquered province”
theory of Stevens. Ordinances of secession they held to be
null and void; these measures in no way impaired the vitality
or contracted the scope of the Constitution because the power
by which they were temporarily maintained, however near
to attaining its object, had not been crowned with success.
The result of the conflict could alone determine whether the
bond of union between the seceding and the loyal States had
been severed. Armed resistance to the supreme law was
treason in those so engaged, even though such resistance
was decreed by States. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ante bellum</span></i> relations would continue
unimpaired if the General Government succeeded in
suppressing the rebellion. This doctrine, once a State in
the Union always a State, was, so far, in harmony with the
policy adopted by the Administration at the commencement
of hostilities.</p>

<p class='c000'>With all the following propositions, however, the policy
of the Government was not in entire accord, nor, indeed, was
it in exact conformity with the principles above ascribed to the
President. The people of a State, the Democratic leaders
asserted, are the State, in the widest sense of that term,
and they make its fundamental law; to be their constitution
it must be their unrestrained and voluntary act, not a result
of coercion or intimidation. When they have freely acted,
then the only essential conditions of a State constitution, in
its Federal relations, are that it should be republican in form
and not conflict with the Constitution of the United States.
South Carolina, for example, was made a member of the
Union by the Constitution and the consent of her people;
except successful revolution no other power could unmake
her. That revolution being unsuccessful she was still in
the Union. The idea that a State was partly out of and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>partly in the Union, Democratic doctrine regarded as an
absurdity. State officers, indeed, could commit suicide; a
majority of its people could commit suicide; but the State did
not, therefore, cease to exist, for the idea of a State involved
the fourfold notion of a defined territory, people occupying it,
functions constituting a system of government and officers to
administer it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Representative Joseph K. Edgerton, of Indiana, in an able
speech delivered February 20, 1865, said that he accepted the
principle of President Lincoln’s inaugural and only regretted
that after so clear and sound a statement of constitutional law
and good intentions the President had subsequently come to the
same conclusion as Mr. Stevens. The theory then announced
was the only one consistent with the true constitutional idea
that the Federal Union is a perpetual union of States, and
that each State, as an individual member of the Union, has
in itself the same element of perpetuity that belongs to the
aggregate Republic formed by the Federal union of States.
The Union can be held to be perpetual only on the principle
that the States composing it are perpetual corporations or
bodies politic, and indestructible by any act of the aggregate
body or by their own act. The States united cannot destroy
a single commonwealth; power to do that is power to consolidate
the States into one. A single member cannot destroy the
Union; power to do that is power to secede, and neither consolidation
nor secession is a principle of the Union. Here
we have in amplified form the celebrated declaration of Chief
Justice Chase, that the Constitution in all its provisions contemplates
“an indestructible union of indestructible States.”<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c010'><sup>[302]</sup></a>
For a different though a very able presentation of Democratic
theory the reader is referred to the address of Mr. Pendleton
on the bill to guarantee republican forms of government to the
rebellious States.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c010'><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Though this theory of a perpetual Union was the one almost
universally held at the beginning of the war, it came during
the progress of the conflict to be little regarded by the dominant
party in Congress; by Republican leaders it was soon cast
aside with indignation or contempt; it remained unaltered
when their views of State status were adapted to changed conditions,
and the Democratic organization, so far at least as
reconstruction was concerned, settled down into little more
than a party of protest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The silence in which Sumner’s propositions were received
may be regarded as a negative testimony to the conservative
sentiments of Senators even after war had existed for nearly
a year; the House, however, just twelve months before the
Massachusetts Senator offered his plan, February 11, 1861,
made a positive declaration of its opinion relative to the limitations
of Federal authority by passing unanimously the following
resolution: “That neither Congress, nor the people
or the governments of the non-slaveholding States, have the
right to legislate upon or interfere with slavery in any of
the slaveholding States in the Union.”<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c010'><sup>[304]</sup></a> This deliberate expression
establishes beyond question the fact that the Constitution,
as then understood, gave no authority to the Federal
Government to interfere with, control or regulate relations
between master and slave in any State which recognized the
right of property in man. On this subject the people were
practically unanimous, their Representatives entirely so. Even
three months of war, with all the antagonisms and all the bitterness
excited, failed to shake this conviction.</p>

<p class='c000'>On July 22, 1861, the day after the disaster at Bull Run,
Representative Crittenden, of Kentucky, introduced the following
resolution:</p>

<p class='c013'>That the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon the
country by the disunionists of the Southern States, now in arms against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the constitutional Government, and in arms around the capital; that
in this national emergency, Congress, banishing all feelings of mere
passion or resentment, will recollect only its duty to the whole country;
that this war is not waged on their part in any spirit of oppression, or
for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, or purpose of overthrowing
or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those States,
but to defend and maintain the <em>supremacy</em> of the Constitution, and to
preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the
several States unimpaired; and that as soon as these objects are accomplished
the war ought to cease.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only two votes were recorded against it.<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c010'><sup>[305]</sup></a> Four days later
Andrew Johnson offered in the upper House a resolution in
nearly the same language, and it was opposed by only five
Senators. There is little doubt that this practical unanimity
in Congress reflected the sentiment of almost the entire North.
This conspicuous landmark, so frequently referred to before
the reunion was completed, will be useful to show how far
the warring factions drifted during the progress of the conflict.</p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Trumbull, of Illinois, who disliked certain expressions
in the form in which it was proposed, said, relative to the
object of the war as declared by the resolution:</p>

<p class='c013'>I trust this war is prosecuted for the purpose of subjugating all
rebels and traitors who are in arms against the Government. What
do you mean by “subjugation”? I know that persons in the Southern
States have sought to make this a controversy between States and the
Federal Government, and have talked about coercing States and subjugating
States; but, sir, it has never been proposed, so far as I know, on
the part of the Union people of the United States, to subjugate States or
coerce States. It is proposed, however, to subjugate citizens who are
standing out in defiance of the laws of the Union, and to coerce them into
obedience to the laws of the Union. I dislike that word in this connection.
In its broadest sense I am opposed to it. If it means the war is not
for the purpose of the subjugation of traitors and rebels into obedience to
the laws, then I am opposed to it. I trust the war is prosecuted for that
very purpose. I move to strike out the words “and in arms around
the capital,” and also the words “or subjugation.”<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c010'><sup>[306]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Mr. Harris, of New York, said: “If slavery shall be abolished,
shall be overthrown as a consequence of this war, I
shall not shed a tear over that result; but, sir, it is not the
purpose of the Government to prosecute this war for the purpose
of overthrowing slavery. If it comes as a consequence,
let it come; but it is not an end of the war.”<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c010'><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the succeeding chapter will be traced with some degree
of fullness the sentiments on reconstruction, in July, 1864, not
only of the majority but of every important element composing
Congress. The position then attained by the average
Republican member, it must be repeated, was not reached at a
single bound. Its progress has been described in the preceding
pages. The vote on the Crittenden resolution marks the
starting point. There was then, though war had existed for
three months, no diversity of opinion worthy of notice. The
successive advances from the declaration, February 11, 1861,
that neither Congress nor the governments of the free States
had a constitutional right to interfere with slavery in any
slaveholding State of the Union to the passage by both
Houses, July 2, 1864, of the Wade-Davis bill, which proposed
by Federal law to regulate the franchise in the rebellious
States, to appoint provisional governors (empowered to dissolve
State conventions), and to prescribe provisions for their
local constitutions, form one of the most instructive commentaries
on the importance of necessity as a principle of constitutional
interpretation.</p>

<p class='c000'>A resolution introduced December 4, 1861, by Mr. Holman,
of Indiana, for the purpose of getting the House to re-affirm
the Crittenden propositions of July 22 preceding, was
tabled by a vote of 71 to 65.<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c010'><sup>[308]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A discussion of the various theories of reconstruction might
seem to require in this place, by way of anticipation, at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>a summary of the Congressional plan; but as this was the
mode of reorganization which was finally imposed on the
South it is preferred to present its development chronologically
and to consider it apart. Several of the remaining
chapters will be devoted to an account of its successive modifications
until the subject was taken, in December, 1865, altogether
out of Executive hands.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>VII<br /> <span class='large'>RISE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>A previous chapter, in relating the military events
which succeeded the disaster at Chickamauga, noticed
a suggestion of the defeated Federal commander as
well as Mr. Lincoln’s reply relative to the publication at that
time of a declaration of amnesty to those in arms against the
Government.<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c010'><sup>[309]</sup></a> The double victory of Mission Ridge and
Lookout Mountain, following the removal of Rosecrans, confirmed
the President in his purpose of offering a general pardon
to those who would lay down their arms and return to
their obedience to the laws. The Proclamation of December
8, 1863, followed promptly and brought the subject of reconstruction
before the Thirty-eighth Congress at its first session.
The preceding pages have alluded to the universal
favor with which that announcement was received. Though
opposition to Executive measures was hushed for the time,
it appears only to have gathered strength in this brief interval
of silence. One short week introduced into the House of
Representatives a resolution the subsequent progress of which
brought the dominant party in Congress to the support of a
measure hostile to that submitted by the President. Its interesting
history may be collected from the pages of the <cite>Congressional
Globe</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>On December 15, from the Committee of Ways and Means,
Thaddeus Stevens reported among other resolutions one to
refer so much of the President’s message as was contained in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>the Proclamation, and as related to the condition and treatment
of rebellious States, to a special committee of nine to be
appointed by the Speaker. Henry Winter Davis inquired
whether Mr. Stevens would accept for that resolution an
amendment pointing more directly to the purpose in view.
This substitute read as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>That so much of the President’s message as relates to the duty
of the United States to guarantee a republican form of government
to the States in which the governments recognized by the United
States have been abrogated or overthrown, be referred to a select committee
of nine, to be named by the Speaker, which shall report the
bills necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing
guaranty.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c010'><sup>[310]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Stevens offering no objection, Representative Davis remarked
that the language of the resolution was general, and,
he believed, would cover the whole war; the committee, he
supposed, intended to point to what, in the very inaccurate
phraseology of the day, was known as the question of reconstruction;
but believing there had been no destruction, he
carefully avoided the use of that term.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Government of the United States, continued Mr.
Davis, was engaged in two operations: the suppression of
armed resistance to the supreme authority of the nation and a
very delicate, and perhaps as high a duty—to see, when
armed resistance should be overcome, that governments republican
in form should be restored in all those States. His
substitute directed the investigations of the committee to that
one point. It was not intended as a peremptory instruction to
the committee to report any particular measure, but to take
such action as their wisdom should recommend.</p>

<p class='c000'>Democratic feeling on this subject appears in an inquiry by
Representative Brooks, of New York, as to whether republican
governments had not been abrogated and overturned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>north as well as south of the Potomac since the revolution
began.<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c010'><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The amendment of Mr. Davis prevailed, and of the special
committee appointed he was made chairman. On January
18, 1864, he asked unanimous consent to report a bill to guarantee
certain States a republican form of government. Objection
having been made, he moved a suspension of the rules;
but failing to receive the necessary two thirds vote his motion
was lost. On February 15 succeeding, when he brought the
measure before the House again and requested a postponement
of its consideration for two weeks, it encountered Democratic
opposition. The bill was then read a first and second time,
ordered to be printed, and returned to the committee.</p>

<p class='c000'>On March 22 the bill came before the House on the question
of ordering it to be engrossed and read a third time. In
its support Mr. Davis made an able address in which he analyzed
the plan proposed by the Executive and emphasized its
deficiencies. He said:</p>

<p class='c013'>The bill which I am directed by the Committee on the Rebellious
States to report is one which provides for the restoration of civil government
in States whose governments have been overthrown. It prescribes
such conditions as will secure not merely civil government to the people
of the rebellious States, but will also secure to the people of the United
States permanent peace after the suppression of the rebellion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The bill challenges the support of all who consider slavery the
cause of the rebellion, and that in it the embers of rebellion will always
smoulder; of those who think that freedom and permanent peace are
inseparable, and who are determined, so far as their constitutional authority
will allow them, to secure these fruits by adequate legislation.</p>

<p class='c013'>... It is entitled to the support of all gentlemen upon this
side of the House, whatever their views may be of the nature of the
rebellion; and the relation in which it has placed the people and
States in rebellion toward the United States, not less of those who
think that the rebellion has placed the citizens of the rebel States
beyond the protection of the Constitution, and that Congress, therefore,
has supreme power over them as conquered enemies, than of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>other class who think that they have not ceased to be citizens and
States of the United States, though incapable of exercising political
privileges under the Constitution, but that Congress is charged with a
high political power by the Constitution to guarantee republican governments
in the States, and that this is the proper time and the proper
mode of exercising it. It is also entitled to the favorable consideration
of gentlemen upon the other side of the House, who honestly and
deliberately express their judgment that slavery is dead. To them it
puts the question whether it is not advisable to bury it out of our
sight, that its ghost may no longer stalk abroad to frighten us from our
propriety.</p>

<p class='c013'>It does not address itself to that class of gentlemen upon the other
side of the House, if there be any, nor to that class of the people of the
country who look for political alliance to the men who head the rebellion
in the South....</p>

<p class='c013'>It purports, sir, not to exercise a revolutionary authority, but to be
an execution of the Constitution of the United States, of the fourth
section of the fourth article of that Constitution, which not merely
confers the power upon Congress, but imposes upon Congress the
duty of guaranteeing to every State in this Union a republican form
of government. That clause vests in the Congress of the United
States a plenary, supreme, unlimited political jurisdiction, paramount
over courts, subject only to the judgment of the people of the United
States, embracing within its scope every legislative measure necessary
and proper to make it effectual; and what is necessary and proper the
Constitution refers, in the first place, to our judgment, subject to no
revision but that of the people. It recognizes no other tribunal. It recognizes
the judgment of no court. It refers to no authority except
the judgment and will of the majority of Congress, and of the people
on that judgment, if any appeal from it.</p>

<p class='c013'>[Secession he described as] the act of the people of the States,
carrying with it all the consequences of such an act. And therefore it
must be either a legal revolution which makes them independent, and
makes of the United States a foreign country, or it is a usurpation
against the authority of the United States, the erection of governments
which do not recognize the Constitution of the United States,
which the Constitution does not recognize, and, therefore, not republican
governments of the States in rebellion. The latter is the view
which all parties take of it. I do not understand that any gentleman on
the other side of the House says that any rebel government which
does not recognize the Constitution of the United States, and which is
not recognized by Congress, is a State government within the meaning
of the Constitution. Still less can it be said that there is a State
government, republican or un-republican, in the State of Tennessee,
where there is no government of any kind, no civil authority, no organized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>form of administration except that represented by the flag
of the United States, obeying the will, and under the orders of the
military officer in command. It is the language of the President of
the United States in every proclamation, of Congress in every law on the
statute-book, of both Houses in their forms of proceeding, and of the
Courts of the United States in their administration of the law. It is
the result of every principle of law, of every suggestion of political
philosophy, that there can be no republican government within the
limits of the United States that does not recognize, but does repudiate,
the Constitution, and which the President and the Congress of the
United States do not, on their part, recognize. Those that are here represented
are the only governments existing within the limits of the
United States. Those that are not here represented are not governments
of the States, republican under the Constitution. And if they be
not, then they are military usurpations, inaugurated as the permanent
governments of the States, contrary to the supreme law of the land,
arrayed in arms against the Government of the United States; and it
is the duty, the first and highest duty, of the Government to suppress and
expel them. Congress must either expel, or recognize and support them.
If it do not guarantee them, it is bound to expel them; and they who are
not ready to suppress them are bound to recognize them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In the famous Rhode Island cases,” he continued, the
Supreme Court of the United States by the mouth of Chief
Justice Taney, declared “that a military government, established
as the permanent government of a State, is not a republican
government in the meaning of the Constitution, and
that it is the duty of Congress to suppress it. That duty Congress
is now executing by its armies. He [Justice Taney] further
said in that case that it is the exclusive prerogative of
Congress—of Congress, and not of the President—to determine
what is and what is not the established government of
the State; and, to come to that conclusion, it must judge of
what is and what is not a republican government, and its judgment
is conclusive on the Supreme Court, which cannot judge
of the fact for itself, but accepts the fact declared by the political
department of the Government.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Davis resumed:</p>

<p class='c013'>We are now engaged in suppressing a military usurpation of the
authority of the State government. When that shall have been accomplished,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>there will be no form of State authority in existence which
Congress can recognize. Our success will be the overthrow of all
semblance of government in the rebel States. The Government of the
United States is then, in fact, the <em>only</em> Government existing in those
States, and it is there charged to guarantee them republican governments.</p>

<p class='c013'>... The duty of guaranteeing carries with it the right to pass all
laws necessary and proper to guaranty.... It places in the hands
of Congress the right to say what is and what is not, with all the light of
experience and all the lessons of the past, inconsistent, in its judgment,
with the permanent continuance of republican government; and if, in
its judgment, any form of policy is radically and inherently inconsistent
with the permanent and enduring peace of the country, with the permanent
supremacy of republican government, and it have the manliness
to say so, there is no power, judicial or executive, in the United States,
that can even question this judgment but the <span class='sc'>People</span>; and they can do
it only by sending other representatives here to undo our work. The
very language of the Constitution and the necessary logic of the case
involve that consequence. The denial of the right of secession means
that all the territory of the United States shall remain under the jurisdiction
of the Constitution. If there can be no State government which
does not recognize the Constitution, and which the authorities of the
United States do not recognize, then there are these alternatives, and
these only: the rebel States must be governed by Congress till they
submit and form a State government under the Constitution; or Congress
must recognize State governments which do not recognize either Congress
or the Constitution of the United States; or there must be an entire
absence of <em>all</em> government in the rebel States; and that is anarchy. To
recognize a government which does not recognize the Constitution is
absurd, for a government is not a constitution; and the recognition of
a State government means the acknowledgment of men as governors,
and legislators, and judges, actually invested with power to make laws,
to judge of crimes, to convict the citizens of other States, to demand the
surrender of fugitives from justice, to arm and command the militia,
to require the United States to repress all opposition to its authority,
and to protect it from invasion—against our own armies; whose Senators
and Representatives are <em>entitled</em> to seats in Congress, and whose
electoral votes must be counted in the election of the President of a
Government which they disown and defy!! To accept the alternative of
anarchy as the constitutional condition of a State is to assert the failure
of the Constitution and the end of republican government. Until, therefore,
Congress recognize a State government, organized under its auspices,
there is no government in the rebel States except the authority of
Congress. In the absence of all State government, the duty is imposed
on Congress ... to administer civil government until the people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>shall, under its guidance, submit to the Constitution of the United
States, and, under the laws which it shall impose, and on the conditions
Congress may require, reorganize a republican government for themselves,
and Congress shall recognize that government.</p>

<p class='c013'>... Is it yet time to reorganize the State governments? or is
there not an intermediate period in which sound legislative wisdom
requires that the authority of Congress shall take possession of and
temporarily control the States now in rebellion until peace shall be
restored and republican government can be established deliberately, undisturbed
by the sound or fear of arms, and under the guidance of
law?</p>

<p class='c000'>After referring to the condition of the rebellion, Mr. Davis
declared: “We have occupied a vast area wrested from its
power, but to this day we have not expelled the rebels from
<em>any State</em> they ever held.” In no portion of those States could
military power “be withdrawn for a moment without instant
insurrection”; and he added, “There is no rebel State held
now by the United States enough of whose population adheres
to the Union to be intrusted with the government of the State.
One tenth cannot control nine tenths. Five tenths are nowhere
willing to undertake the control of the other five
tenths.” In West Virginia, he said, such a condition existed
and had been recognized. “In no other State—the only one
in respect to which a doubt can exist is Tennessee—in no
other State is there such a portion of territory held, or any
such portion of population under our control, or any such portion
of it which is in our control inspired by such sentiments
toward the Government of the United States, so free from
fear of the returning wave of rebel invasion, so assured of the
continued supremacy of the United States, that we ought to
be willing to trust them with this power. You can get a
handful of men in the several States who would be glad to
take the offices if protected by the troops of the United States,
but you have nowhere a body of independent, loyal partisans
of the United States, ready to meet the rebels in arms, ready to
die for the Republic, who claim the Constitution as their birthright,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>count all other privileges light in comparison, and resolve
at every hazard to maintain it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Concerning the loyal masses of the South, of whom so
much was heard at the beginning of the war, he remarked:</p>

<p class='c013'>It is the most astounding spectacle in history that in the Southern
States, with more than half of the population opposed to it, a great
revolution was effected against their wishes and against their votes,
without a battle, a riot, or a protest in behalf of the beneficent Government
of their fathers—a revolution whose opponents hastened to lead it,
without a martyr to the cause they deserted except the nameless heroes
of the mountains of Tennessee, or a confessor of the faith they had
avowed save the illustrious Petigru of South Carolina!</p>

<p class='c013'>... There is no fact that any one has stated on authority at all
reliable that any respectable proportion of the people of the Southern
States now in rebellion are willing to accept any terms that even our
opponents on the other side of the House are willing to offer them.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>What, then, are we to do with the population in these States? To
make “confusion worse confounded” by erecting by the side of the
hostile State government a new State government on the shifting sands
of that whirlpool, to be supported by us while we are there and to
turn its power against us when we are driven out? That would be to
erect a new throne where</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Chaos umpire sits,</div>
      <div class='line'>And by decision more embroils the fray</div>
      <div class='line'>By which he reigns.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In my judgment, it is not safe to confide the vast authority of State
governments to the doubtful loyalty of the rebel States until armed
rebellion shall have been trampled into the dust, until every armed rebel
shall have vanished from the State, until there shall be in the South no
hope of independence and no fear of subjection, until the United States
is bearded by no military power and the laws can be executed by courts
and sheriffs without the ever-present menace of military authority.
Until we have reached that point, this bill proposes that the President
shall appoint a civil governor to administer the government under the
laws of the United States in force in the States respectively at the outbreak
of the rebellion, subject, of course, to the necessities of military
occupation.</p>

<p class='c000'>When military opposition shall have been suppressed, continued
Mr. Davis, then call upon the people to reorganize their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>governments in their own way, “subject to the conditions
that we think essential to our permanent peace, and to prevent
the revival hereafter of the rebellion....”</p>

<p class='c000'>To establish republican forms of government that the people
of the United States would agree to, three modes were indicated:
“One is to remove the cause of the war by an alteration
of the Constitution of the United States prohibiting slavery
everywhere within its limits. That, sir, goes to the root
of the matter, and should consecrate the nation’s triumph.
But there are thirty-four States—three fourths of them would
be twenty-six. I believe there are twenty-five States represented
in this Congress, so that we, on that basis, cannot
change the Constitution. It is, therefore, a condition precedent
in that view of the case, that more States shall have
governments organized within them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He next noticed the calculation based on three fourths of
the States then represented in Congress, a construction held
by Thaddeus Stevens, but even that view was not without its
difficulties. The States of New Jersey, Kentucky, Maryland
and Delaware were named as doubtful. If such an
amendment were adopted it still left “the whole field of the
civil administration of the States prior to the recognition of
State governments, all laws necessary to the ascertainment of
the will of the people, and all restrictions on the return to
power of the leaders of the rebellion, wholly unprovided for.”
The constitutional amendment met his hearty approval, but
it was not a complete remedy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Relative to the Administration policy, he observed:</p>

<p class='c013'>The next plan is that inaugurated by the President of the United
States in the proclamation of the 8th of December, called the amnesty
proclamation. That proposes no guardianship of the United States
over the reorganization of the governments, no law to prescribe who shall
vote, no civil functionaries to see that the law is faithfully executed,
no supervising authority to control and judge of the election. But
if, in any manner, by the toleration of martial law, lately proclaimed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>fundamental law, under the dictation of any military authority, or
under the prescriptions of a provost marshal, something in the form of
a government shall be presented, represented to rest on the votes of one
tenth of the population, the President will recognize that, provided it
does not <em>contravene</em> the proclamation of freedom and the laws of Congress;
and, to secure that, an oath is exacted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now you will observe that there is no guarantee of law to watch over
the organization of that government. It may combine all the population
of a State; it may combine one tenth only; or ten governments may
come competing for recognition at the door of the Executive mansion.
The executive authority is pledged; Congress is not pledged. It may be
recognized by the military power and may not be recognized by the civil
power, so that it would have a doubtful existence, half civil and half
military, neither a temporary government by law of Congress nor a State
government, something as unknown to the Constitution as the rebel government
that refuses to recognize it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In examining the operation of the Executive proclamation
on the existence of slavery, Mr. Davis asked, how does it
accomplish the reorganization of the government on the basis
of universal freedom? and added:</p>

<p class='c013'>The only prescription is that the government shall not <em>contravene</em> the
provisions of that proclamation. Sir, if that proclamation be valid, then
we are relieved from all trouble on that score; but if that proclamation
be not valid, then the oath to support it is without legal sanction, for
the President can ask no man to bind himself by an oath to support an
unfounded proclamation or an unconstitutional law even for a moment,
still less till it shall have been declared void by the Supreme Court of
the United States.... If, therefore, he shall have taken the oath,
he can, in good conscience as well as in good law, disregard it the
next moment; so that, in point of fact, the law leaves us where the
proclamation does; it adds nothing to its legality, nothing to its force.</p>

<p class='c013'>But what is the proclamation which the new governments must not
contravene? That certain negroes shall be free, and that certain other
negroes shall remain slaves. The proclamation therefore recognizes the
existence of slavery. It does just exactly what all the constitutions of
the rebel States prior to the rebellion did; ... and, therefore, the
old constitutions might be restored to-morrow without <em>contravening</em> the
proclamation of freedom. Those constitutions do not say that the President
shall not have the right, in the exercise of his military authority,
to emancipate slaves within the States.... They do not even
establish slavery.... They merely recognize it just as the proclamation
recognizes its existence in parts of Virginia and in parts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Louisiana. So that the one tenth of the population at whose hands
the President proposes to accept and guarantee a State government,
can elect officers under the old constitution of their State in exactly the
same terms and with exactly the same powers existing at the time of the
rebellion, and may, under his proclamation, demand a recognition....
So soon as the State government is recognized, the operation
of the proclamation becomes merely a judicial question. The right of a
negro to his freedom is a legal right divesting a right of property,
and is to be enforced in the courts; and then the question is what the
courts will say about the proclamation. Is it valid or invalid? Does
it of itself confer a legal right to freedom on negroes who were slaves?
Is it within the authority of the Executive?... How local State
courts, created by the Southern people, will decide such a question
<em>no one</em> can doubt.... It is, therefore, under the scheme of the
President, merely a judicial question, to be adjudged by judicial rules, and
to be determined by the courts.... I do not desire to argue the
legality of the proclamation of freedom. I think it safer to <em>make it law</em>....
Under the act of 1862 the President is authorized to use the
negro population for the suppression of the rebellion; while the rebellion
lasts, his proclamation in law exempts the slave from the duty of obeying
his master, but after the rebellion is extinguished, the master’s rights
are in his own hands, subject only to the opinion of the courts on the
legal effect of the proclamation, without a single precedent to sanction
it, and opposed by the solemn assertions of our Government against the
principle worked to authorize it. Gentlemen are less prudent or less in
earnest than I am if they will risk the great issues involved in this
question on such authorities before the courts of justice.</p>

<p class='c013'>By the bill we propose to preclude the judicial question by the solution
of a political question. How so? By the paramount power of
Congress to reorganize governments in those States, to impose such conditions
as it thinks necessary to secure the permanence of republican
government, to refuse to recognize any governments there which do
not prohibit slavery forever. Ay, gentlemen take the responsibility to
say, in the face of those who clamor for speedy recognition of governments
tolerating slavery, that the safety of the people of the United
States is the supreme law; that their will is the supreme rule of law,
and that we are authorized to pronounce their will on this subject—take
the responsibility to say that we will revise the judgments of our
ancestors; that we have experience written in blood which they had
not; that we find now, what they darkly doubted, that slavery is really,
radically inconsistent with the permanence of republican governments;
and that, being charged by the supreme law of the land, on our conscience
and judgment, to guarantee, that is, to continue, maintain, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>enforce, if it exist, to institute and restore when overthrown, republican
governments throughout the broad limits of the republic, we will weed
out every element of their policy which we think incompatible with its
permanence and endurance.... It [the bill] adds to the authority
of the proclamation the sanction of Congress....</p>

<p class='c013'>Gentlemen must deny the jurisdiction of Congress over the States
where there are no recognized governments, or place a bound or limit
to the discretion of Congress....</p>

<p class='c013'>And if the sentiments of State pride and State rights be touched by
the assertion of this wide discretion, which men may deny but cannot
expunge, I would admonish those who dislike it that it is a jurisdiction
which nothing but the dereliction of the States can wake into activity,
and they who wish to exclude it from their limits have only not to give
occasion for its exercise by renouncing obedience to the Constitution
and pulling down their own State governments. But now the jurisdiction
has attached in all the rebel States. Until Congress has assented,
there is no State government in any rebel State, and none will be
recognized except such as recognize the power of the United States; so
that we come down to this: whether we—and when I say we, I mean
we upon this side of the House, who are firmly, thoroughly, and honestly
convinced that the time has come not merely to strike the arms
from the hands of the rebels, but to strike the fetters from the arms of
the slaves, and remove that domineering and cohesive power without
which we could have had no rebellion, and which now is its animating
spirit, and which will die when it dies—....</p>

<p class='c013'>And if it be time [for Congress to assert its authority] then all I ask
in conclusion is, that gentlemen will go and read that great argument of
Daniel Webster in the Rhode Island case ... where he met this
semi-revolutionary attempt to count heads and call that the people, and
maintained—and so the Supreme Court judged when it refused to take
jurisdiction of the question—that the great political law of America is
that every change of government shall be conducted under the supervising
authority of some existing legislative body throwing the protection
of law around the polls, defining the rights of voters, protecting
them in the exercise of the elective franchise, guarding against fraud,
repelling violence, and appointing arbiters to pronounce the result and
declare the persons chosen by the people.... He [Webster]
maintained it to be the great fundamental principle of the American
government that legislation shall guide every political change, and that
it assumes that somewhere within the United States there is always a
permanent, organized legal authority which shall guide the tottering footsteps
of those who seek to restore governments which are disorganized
and broken down.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>The bill, he asserted in conclusion, was an effort to apply
this great principle of American law.<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c010'><sup>[312]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Representative Scofield, of Pennsylvania, said, April 29,
1864, when the subject was again before the House, that the
continuity of constitutional government in the seceded States
had been broken, the regular transmission of political power
interrupted. How, he inquired, should the severed thread
be joined? By the unconstrained action of the people themselves,
say the gentlemen in opposition. He indorsed that
sentiment, and added that when the people of those States
should ground the arms of their rebellion, and uncoerced
take upon themselves the easy yoke and light burden of the
ever gentle Federal Government it would mark a glad day in
those uncheerful years of our history.</p>

<p class='c000'>For those States from which hostile armies had been excluded
Congress should legislate or leave the people in the
rough hand of military law. The bill designed to discharge
that duty was generally acceptable to any one who conceded
the propriety of Congressional action, its three prohibitions
being probably the only debatable points,—that is the assumption
of Confederate debts, the prevention of Confederate
officers from voting and the prohibition of involuntary servitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>To assume the rebel debt, he asserted, would be to offer a
high bounty for future rebellions; if rebel officers were permitted
to vote, upon what principle of comparative justice
could the privilege be denied to ordinary criminals? These
officers were guilty of the highest crime against government.
As to the third prohibition he had more to say.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If God shall give us victory,” continued Mr. Scofield,
“and enable us to subdue or scatter the army of the enemy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>is a voluntary reunion of the States possible? I say <em>voluntary</em>
because I suppose nobody desires a Union always to be
maintained by force; and I use the word <em>reunion</em> because nobody
proposes a form of government different from our present
system of State brotherhood. I am not now speaking of the
several plans of reconstruction, for they are designed only
as temporary devices, looking to a reunion.... My
question looks beyond the battle and beyond reconstruction.
When the victory is won, if won it shall be, and the transition
over, will the insurgent States <em>willingly stay</em> where they have
been <em>forcibly put</em> in their old places in the old Union?...
Our own liberties could not survive their permanent subjugation.
When the Federal Government becomes strong enough
to hold eleven States as colonies, it will be too strong, I fear,
for the people’s liberties.” All motives for those States ever
to depart should be removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Similarity of ideas he characterized as the bond of nationality,
and named Ireland, Hungary and Poland to show the
opposite. In the United States slavery was the one subject
of estrangement. Could North and South be brought to
think alike on that subject? The theory that each side could
hold its own opinions on slavery and no evil consequences
follow was somewhat to blame. That theory failed in practice
and for that failure each side blamed the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fathers, he said, lived under that theory, that slavery
and freedom could coexist, but they expected that the institution
would soon become extinct. Hence they only tolerated
it. Slavery was to recede slowly and freedom to follow
steadily. Upon <em>that</em> basis they got along very well and so
could their descendants. Instead of consenting to go, slavery
demanded expansion and perpetuity. This was reversing the
compromise of the fathers; this change had to be discussed,
the slave power took umbrage and secession followed. If one
sentiment must prevail, then slavery, which could not stand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>discussion, must yield if there was to be a reunion. To live in
peace together the North must embrace slavery or the South
must abandon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>To adopt slavery would mean the adoption by 20,000,000
people of sentiments favorable thereto, whereas the institution
never had any friends in the North. Those in that section
so considered were only its apologists. If, three years ago,
slavery had no real friends in the North, who would advocate
it when it had attempted to destroy the most beneficent of
governments? To reconcile the free States would necessitate
a change of opinion—to adopt freedom as the dominant idea
would require simply a change of <em>investment</em> in the sections.
For the present extinguish the conflagration, for the future
remove the inflammable material from which it was kindled.
For the present seize the mad revolutionists of the
South, for the future destroy the virus that poisoned their
blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>All who favored emancipation he favored as co-workers for
a voluntary and peaceful reunion of the States; slavery was
presented merely as an element of discord and disunion and
as such he asked for its removal.<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c010'><sup>[313]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Williams said that the war was inaugurated on the
theory that the States were <em>in</em>, whereas the great fact of war
was a proclamation that they were <em>out</em>. Northern Democrats
were willing to accept the fact that they were <em>out, without
war</em>—to adopt the principle of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez nous faire</span></i> of
the rebel authorities and to treat with them upon the idea of
a <em>reconstruction</em>; peaceful secession with <em>reconstruction by
treaty</em>. The severance of the States was complete, though the
hope of recovery remained. By releasing the crews of their
privateers, by blockading their ports the Federal authorities
had recognized them as a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i> government; Federal legislation
had put them under the ban as alien enemies. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>minds of the framers of the Constitution the theory of an
indissoluble Union referred to <em>the right</em>, to its organic law.
They did not mean that it could not be ruptured by violence.
If the governments of the States were dissolved “they must,
of course, be reconstructed under the auspices of the conquering
power, and that not by the Executive, but by the Legislature
of the Union, whose sword he bears, and which only,
consistently with the genius of our institutions, the past practice
of the Government, and the letter as well as spirit of the
Constitution, can venture to determine what use shall be made
of the territories conquered by it, and when and upon what
terms they shall be readmitted into full communion as members
of this Government.... To permit any executive
officer to declare its law, and set it in motion, and place
it under the control of a minority—a mere tithe of its citizens—with
power to send delegates to Congress with representation
unimpaired and unaffected—even though he should reenact
a part of its abrogated Constitution—would be, as I
think, a monstrous anomaly, a violation of fundamental principles,
and a precedent fraught with great danger to republican
liberty.... To come back into the Union, it
must either be born anew or come back with all its rights unimpaired,
except those material ones which have been destroyed
in the progress of the war. There is, I think, no
middle ground, as there is no power either here or elsewhere
to prescribe terms which shall abridge the rights or privileges
of a State that has <em>not</em> been out of the Union, or returns to it
in virtue of its original title.” The rebellious States, he declared,
“are in the Union for correction, not for <em>heirship</em>.”
In point of fact they were out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Replying to an observation of Fernando Wood, Mr. Williams
said: “We are in favor, at all events, of preserving all
that is left of it [the Union], and intend, with the blessing of
God, to win back the residue, and pass it through the fire until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>it shall come out purged of the malignant element that has
unfitted it for freedom.</p>

<p class='c000'>“... Say that they [the rebellious States] are in
the Union as before, and all your sacrifices have been idle,
and all the blood spilled by you has sunk into the earth in
vain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The confiscation and distribution of the great baronial possessions
of rebel leaders were in his judgment an essential
element in any feasible plan of reconstruction. He deduced
from passages in Bynkershoek and Barbeyrac that “everything
belonging to the offending party is confiscated....
<em>Indemnity</em>, <em>security</em>, and <em>punishment</em> are all, therefore, means
of self-defense which may be legitimately used.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Is the forfeiture, he asked, of the estates and property of
traitors, whether they consist of lands or slaves, required for
these purposes? “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vae Victis</span></i>” is not the maxim of a humane
conqueror. Though he would not exclude the idea of
mercy, he was not clear as to “the wisdom of a proclamation
of amnesty in advance as a measure of pacification, without
limits as to time, and where submission after conquest, and
when it is no longer a virtue but a necessity, is to be rewarded
with the same impunity as a voluntary return to duty before
that time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking of the nature, cause and fury of the war, he continued:
“Its suppression has become impossible without removing
the cause of the strife, and disabling our enemy by
liberating his slaves, and arming them against him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>No reparation was adequate for the injury inflicted; for,
said he, “there can be no punishment, except in the divestiture
of the rights and the seizure of the estates of the guilty leaders.
There is no security except in the distribution of the
latter.” From these he would carve out inheritances for the
widow and the helpless offspring of the Northern soldier.</p>

<p class='c000'>For eighteen months, he observed in conclusion, the war
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>was conducted upon the principle of inflicting as little injury
as possible upon the enemy.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c010'><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The speech of Mr. Williams was marked by considerable
fluency as well as great elegance of diction; it was the effort
of a scholar, though not confined strictly to the question before
the House. He introduced with directness and vigor
the ideas of indemnity, security and punishment; these, it
may be remarked, became important elements in determining
the mode of reinstatement that finally emerged from the chaos
of resolutions and plans submitted to Congress.</p>

<p class='c000'>Representative Baldwin, of Michigan, believed the bill “to
be an utter subversion of the Constitution”; even a latitudinarian
construction of that instrument would not justify it.
It embraced a plan that could be enforced by only the military
arm. It was the precursor of the establishment of a despotism.
That measure, as well as the President’s plan, was
fraught with danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>He lamented interference with the elective franchise and
the denial of the privileges of the writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i>. For
eighteen months the war had been waged for the destruction
of the South, not for the restoration of the Union. Did not
wisdom, he asked, suggest that all plans of reconstruction
which tended only to intensify hate and postpone the day of
peace be abandoned? Speaking of the effect of Mr. Lincoln’s
policy he observed: “That it was intended that the
amnesty proclamation of last December would hasten the end
of this strife, I do not believe. We are told that nearly every
Southern paper published it, and it only nerved them to the
performance of more earnest deeds.” The President’s plan
as well as that of Congress, he believed, were designed to perpetuate
the present dominant party by the vote of reconstructed
States. A considerable portion of his remarks was
devoted to criticism of the Administration.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c010'><sup>[315]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Mr. Thayer, of Pennsylvania, believed that the powers
delegated by the people of the United States to the national
Government were sufficient for the great work of reconstruction,
and added: “That the time has come in which Congress,
in the exercise of the great powers conferred upon it,
should settle and authoritatively declare the terms and conditions
upon which the people of the rebellious districts should
be restored to their State privileges and resume their just
relations to the national Government, does not admit of
doubt.” People occupying territory wrested from the rebellion
should be restored with the least possible delay to the
privileges of representative government. “Congress alone
can enact the laws which are to reconstruct the political societies
in which the fundamental principle of loyalty to the
national Government and obedience to its laws and respect
for its authority have been obliterated by the violence of rebellion.
The President of the United States cannot enact
these laws, and it is in my opinion a reproach to Congress that
by its inaction up to the present time it has rendered it necessary
that the national Executive should be obliged by a sense
of obligation to the public welfare to resort to temporary expedients
for the preservation of public order and the assertion
of national supremacy in those districts and States which
the valor of our soldiers has redeemed from the insulting
domination of the rebel army.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Executive action, he asserted, was suggested by necessity.
“What has been done in that respect by the President I believe
to have been well done, wisely done, and patriotically
done, and to have been demanded alike by the necessity
of the case and for the welfare of the Republic.” The exclusive
right over the subject, however, belonged to Congress,
which should relieve the President of all responsibility therein.</p>

<p class='c000'>Safeguards against the recurrence of similar outbreaks in
the future should be required. He would support the measure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>before the House because of these safeguards or pledges.
Unconditional and perpetual loyalty in the new governments
in the rebellious States to that of the United States, extirpation
and perpetual prohibition of slavery and compulsory
repudiation of the rebel debt were the chief among these.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The safety of the country,” said he, “its future repose,
the continuance of the Union, and the firm establishment of
our political system imperatively demand that in the reorganization
of local governments in the rebel States the foundations
of such governments must rest upon the principle of submission
to the Constitution and laws of the United States.</p>

<p class='c000'>“... It is also necessary to guard the elective
franchise and the privilege of holding office in those States
against the intrusion and treachery of all who have in any
sense been leaders in the present rebellion. For this purpose
prudence requires that all who have held office under the
pretended rebel government should be excluded from these
privileges.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The seventh section of the bill he would like to see so modified
as to declare that no debt of the pretended Confederate
States, and no debt contracted by the State for the purpose of
prosecuting the war against the United States or of giving
aid to its enemies, should be recognized or paid by the State.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a singular doctrine, he remarked in conclusion, that
those who had thrown off all restraints of the Constitution
and who for years had waged war for the purpose of overthrowing
it should be entitled to demand its protection while
engaged in armed hostility to it.<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c010'><sup>[316]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Yeaman did not believe Congress had a right to legislate
away the laws and institutions of these States. The
American people, he said, would come out of the contest with
a better political education, an education having for its basis
the idea that <em>they are a nation</em>, and he added, “a war to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>enforce the theory of secession will end in an increased consolidated
nationality.” The theory expressed in the Virginia
and Kentucky Resolutions was the fatal blow in our political
history. His address was in the nature of an essay in political
science and not altogether germane to the measure under
consideration.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c010'><sup>[317]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“Pass a judicious enabling act,” urged Mr. Longyear,
“with proper safeguards, of which the people may avail
themselves to organize civil governments at the very earliest
opportunity, and it will afford a rallying point for the Union
sentiment remaining there, and tend to foster it and nourish
it into a healthful and vigorous existence. It will prevent
perplexing and complicated irregularities and diversities of
action, and tend largely to harmony and strength in our future
deliberations. No stronger illustration of the necessity and
propriety of immediate action need be given than the case of
Tennessee, Louisiana, and Arkansas.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The President’s proclamation does not solve the difficulty.
As a proclamation of amnesty, as a general outline
or plan for organizing new State governments, as a prescription
of safeguards and conditions precedent to such organization,
it will ever stand as a bright and glorious page in the
history of the present Administration. But it is incomplete
for lack of constitutional power. That can be conferred by
Congress alone, under the power to admit new States.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'>“If we succeed [in the war] we make no conquest of territory,
because that is already ours. We simply succeed, in
that respect, in bringing that which is our own again under
our control.” Because of rebellion the constitutions and laws
of those States had ceased to exist, and as slavery was established
solely in State laws that also ceased to exist. The only
object of a constitutional amendment was to prohibit its establishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>forever. Freedom, he added, was being substituted
for slavery. In respect to slavery and the slave power
we were in the midst of a revolution. They proved themselves
inimical to civil liberty, to the Constitution and to republican
institutions.<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c010'><sup>[318]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>To the remark of Fernando Wood, of New York, that
the South could not be subdued, Ignatius Donnelly replied,
“We are doing it!” and he added, if the system of the
President is deficient in the machinery that will ensure
safety “it is our duty to supply that defect. The plan of
the President, unsupported by any action on our part, hangs
upon too many contingencies. It may be repealed by his
successor; it may be resisted by Congress; it may be annulled
by the Supreme Court. It rests the welfare of the
nation upon the mind of one man; it rests the whole structure
of social order upon the unstable foundation of individual
oaths.” Upon this subject Mr. Donnelly observed
that General Jefferson Thompson, C. S. A., noted in
passing through those regions that men consulted their
memorandum books to see what oath they had taken last.
Thousands of rebel dead had been found on the battle field
with oaths of allegiance, sworn to and subscribed, in their
pockets. Mr. Donnelly favored the bill, and if any measure
of greater security could be found he would support that.
He desired, as soon as it could be attained, an amendment of
the Constitution that would prohibit slavery.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am aware, Mr. Speaker,” he continued, “of the great
claims which Mr. Lincoln has upon the people of the United
States. I recognize that popularity which accompanies him,
and which, considering the ordeal through which he has
passed, is little less than miraculous. I recognize that unquestioning
faith in his honesty and ability which pervades
all classes, and the sincere affection with which almost the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>entire population regard him. We must not underrate him
even in our praises. He is a great man. Great not after the
old models of the world, but with a homely and original greatness.
He will stand out to future ages in the history of these
crowded and confused times with wonderful distinctness. He
has carried a vast and discordant population safely and peacefully
through the greatest of political revolutions with such
consummate sagacity and skill that while he led he appeared
to follow; while he innovated beyond all precedent he has
been denounced as tardy; while he struck the shackles from
the limbs of three million slaves he has been hailed as a conservative!
If to adapt, persistently and continuously, just
and righteous principles to all the perplexed windings and
changes of human events, and to secure in the end the complete
triumph of those principles, be statesmanship, then
Abraham Lincoln is the first of statesmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If the end of the war is to be a restoration <em>of the appearance</em>
of the old Government; a patching together of the
broken shreds and fragments; a propping up of the fabric in
such style that the next Administration may possibly get out
from under it before it falls, then that proclamation may be
found all-sufficient. But for all other purposes it will be
utterly unavailing. It does not reach the heart of the distemper....</p>

<p class='c000'>“We owe more than this to ourselves; we owe more than
this to the South. We must regenerate the South.”<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c010'><sup>[319]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This discriminating tribute to the character and genius of
Mr. Lincoln was paid by no servile flatterer; it was not the
eulogy of even a supporter of the Presidential plan of reconstruction;
nor was it designed as a discharge of, or uttered in
expectation of compelling, Executive favors, but appears rather
to have been the spontaneous testimony of a keen interpreter of
men and measures not less creditable to the insight of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>speaker than to the subject of his remarks. Others, it is true,
refrained from misrepresenting the President’s attitude and
cheerfully ascribed to him patriotic and enlightened motives in
his public conduct. Mr. Donnelly alone condensed into a
paragraph a panegyric with which the judgment of posterity
is in complete accord. This portion of his speech is quoted
both to show that there were men in Congress who fully
appreciated the greatness of the President, and that criticism
of his measures was not in many instances suggested by feelings
of personal hostility.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very different were the remarks of Mr. Dennison, who declared
that “The passage of this law will be the final gathering
up of the reserved rights of States, and the last vestige
of protection of the citizen under State constitutions will be
taken away, and all power centralized in the General Government.”
He opposed the bill for the additional reason that it
was intended to legalize and perpetuate the unconstitutional
acts of the President. “There does not exist on the earth a
more despotic government than that of Abraham Lincoln.
He is a despot in fact if not in name.”<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c010'><sup>[320]</sup></a> These excerpts
sufficiently indicate the character of his invective.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have offered a substitute to the bill of the committee,”
said Thaddeus Stevens, “because that does not, in my judgment,
meet the evil. It partially acknowledges the rebel
States to have rights under the Constitution, which I deny,
as war has abrogated them all. I do not inquire what rights
we have under it, but they have none. The bill takes for
granted that the President may partially interfere in their civil
administration, not as conqueror but as President of the
United States. It adopts in some measure the idea that less
than a majority may regulate to some extent the affairs of a
republic.”<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c010'><sup>[321]</sup></a> The chief objection of Mr. Stevens, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>was that it removed the opportunity of confiscating the property
of the disloyal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Representative Wadsworth, of Kentucky, he said, agreed
with him that the people of the South could plead none of the
constitutional provisions in their defence. Whatever rights
they possessed were those of belligerents engaged in war.
“When we come to enforce the rights of conquest,” continued
the Pennsylvania member, “we should be justified
in insisting upon the <em>extreme rights</em> of war, without yielding
to the mitigations dictated by modern usage with regard
to belligerents originally composed of foreign nations
engaged in war which they deemed just.” Explaining
former recommendations which in many quarters had called
forth severe criticism, he said: “I thought that the women
and children, the non-combatants, and those who were
forced by the laws of their State into the armies, should
be spared; and the property of the guilty, morally as well as
politically guilty, only should be taken. And yet we hear a
howl of horror from conservative gentlemen at the inhumanity
of the proposition.” He still further explained his sentiments
on this occasion. After stating that the people of the Confederate
States were sovereign and acted through their representatives,
he asserted that they had commenced and were
continuing to wage an unjust war and therefore their private
property was liable to confiscation. The right to take their
property existed, but no one, he said, “advises the execution
of the extreme right. But the right exists and ought to be
enforced against the most guilty. To allow them to return
with their estates untouched, on the theory that they have
never gone out of the Union, seems to me rank injustice to
loyal men.” Of those who denied that the Confederate States
had gone out of the Union he inquired, “What are we making
war upon them for? For seceding; for going out of
the Union against law. The law forbids a man to rob or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>murder, and yet robbery and murder exist <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i> but not
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</span></i>.” Hence the Constitution does not allow the States
to go out of the Union. He referred also in his speech to a
resolution introduced by Mr. Schenck, of Ohio, which passed
the House without a division and declared the Confederate
States a public enemy, engaged in a public war.<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c010'><sup>[322]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On the same day, May 2, Representative Strouse remarked
that immediately after the disaster of Bull Run the House
almost unanimously passed the Crittenden Resolutions, which
declared that “This war is not waged in any spirit of oppression,
or for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, or purpose
of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established
institutions of these States.” This announcement, he
asserted, brought volunteers, whereas now, 1864, county, State
and Federal bounties combined could not induce men to enlist,
and the cause of the apathy was that the war had been perverted
from the purpose announced in the resolutions referred
to. The entire speech had little reference to the bill of Mr.
Davis, but seemed rather designed, by an attack on the Administration,
to please his Democratic constituents.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c010'><sup>[323]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Cravens said that the dominant party did not distinguish
between loyalty to the Administration and loyalty
to the Government. The time for compromise had passed
when the Republican party refused to accept the Crittenden
Resolutions. That organization was in all essentials an
abolition party. If there ever was a distinction it no longer
existed. He cited a rather complete list of all the measures
acted upon by Congress showing their concern for the negro;
he charged neglect of the white soldier, his widow and orphans;
quoted from the speech of Thaddeus Stevens on the
admission of West Virginia, and named Representative Julian
as uttering sentiments little behind the Pennsylvania member
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>in boldness and exhibiting no more reverence for the Constitution.
The incapacity and dire wickedness of the President
and his “courtiers” came in for a share of criticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Gooch on the following day, May 3, remarked that the
rebellion was but the military phase of the conflict of ideas
which began with the adoption of the Constitution. “When
we shall have crushed the rebellion and restored peace to all
parts of the country we shall hold this territory, not by a
new title, but by the old, not as territory acquired by conquest,
but territory defended and maintained against revolt....
I can see no reason why the President, as Commander-in-Chief,
should not, in the meantime, so use the
military power as to aid and assist the loyal people of any
one of these States in the organization of a loyal State government....
All these acts by the President, or the
military power under him, in thus aiding and assisting the
loyal people in these States, impose no obligation upon Congress
to recognize them until such time as it shall deem proper
to do so, and any recognition the military power may see fit
to give to these governments can never fix their status in the
Union. Congress alone has the power to determine what
government is the legitimate one in a State, and its decision
is binding on the other departments of the Government.”<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c010'><sup>[324]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Perry, of New Jersey, spoke of the duration of the
war, predicted the general bankruptcy which its great expense
would bring about, and calculated that in eleven years
the cost of the war would equal the assessed value of property.</p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking of the Executive plan he said: “And here the
President’s design is perfectly evident, to secure a majority
of the delegates to the nominating convention of his party,
and to provide for his own election by the House of Representatives
in the event of there not being an election by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>people. By this plan the narrow foothold maintained by our
armies in North Carolina, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Florida,
Arkansas, and elsewhere may send the pretended full
delegations of those States to this House. Mr. Speaker, I
denominate the whole plan a political trick worthy of the
most adroit and unscrupulous wire-puller of our ward primary
meetings.” The State governments had not been destroyed,
he added, “nor can they be destroyed unless the rebels are
finally victorious, and establish their independence.”<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c010'><sup>[325]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Fernando Wood said that Mexico had a republican form of
government, and that Texas came into the Union without
changing the character of her government except to substitute
a governor for President and to change the titles of some officials.
Every Southern State possessed the same form of government
which it did before secession. If, he asserted, they
were then republican in form, “they are so now.” The Confederate
constitution had all the elements of republicanism.
The bill provided that hereafter none of the States in rebellion
should hold slaves. It did not leave to the people the right to
regulate their domestic institutions. Is it republicanism to take
from the people this privilege? “To impose upon them a form
of government of your own making, under the pretext of this
bill, would be the worst kind of tyranny, whatever the provisions
of your constitution might be.”<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c010'><sup>[326]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>He defended himself against serious charges of General
Schenck, whom he criticised severely. These accusations,
however, were reiterated by Hon. William D. Kelley, of
Pennsylvania, who at this point rose to speak on the merits
of the bill.</p>

<p class='c000'>The proposed measure did not meet his unqualified approval.
It lacked some of the amendments suggested by Mr. Stevens.
“I should like to see his distinct declaration,” said Congressman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Kelley, “that ‘The Confederate States are a public enemy,
waging an unjust war, whose injustice is so glaring that
they have no right to claim the mitigation of the extreme
rights of war which are accorded by modern usage to an
enemy who has the right to consider the war a just one.’”
He would like to see the bill of Mr. Davis provide also for
the exclusion from Congress of all those States that seceded,
and every part of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>As more immediately important, however, he would prefer
to see included in the measure the proposition of Mr. Stevens
respecting amendments of the Constitution; he denied the
immortality of a State. It has its beginning, its transitions
and may have its end. “A State may be killed, a State may
commit suicide. An act of God, by destroying its inhabitants,
might extinguish a State. A State could be conquered
and held by some strong and hostile power. The political
people of each of those States have overthrown the State.
Through its corporate power each State destroyed its corporate
life, and no one of them exists.” He also denied that
a State could transfer to any foreign power territory within
the jurisdiction of the United States. The Supreme Court
had decided that the Southern States were alien enemies and
entitled to only the rights of such.<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c010'><sup>[327]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The message of the President, Representative S. S. Cox
believed, “should be welcomed, not so much for what it is
as for what it pretends to be. It is his first adventure beyond
the line of force into the field of conciliation....</p>

<p class='c000'>“To test the genuineness of this amnesty: five months have
gone, but we see no signs of thousands of Southern citizens
rushing to embrace this amnesty. Indeed, it is conceded that
the rebellion is now more formidable than ever.” There was
no genuine movement toward the restoration of the seceded
States. He would not take the oath of allegiance and swear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>support of the negro policies. How could Southern men be
expected to take the oath? Its terms provoked or irritated
them still more. The structure, he declared, was built on the
Emancipation Proclamation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bill of Mr. Davis had the same defects. That, too, was
based upon the one tenth system and the policy of forced
emancipation. “In some of its features,” he said, “it is an
improvement upon the rickety establishment proposed by the
President.</p>

<p class='c000'>“... The emancipation act of the gentleman [Lincoln]
can never be reconciled with the normal control of the
States over their domestic institutions, so all oaths to sustain
the same are oaths to subvert the old governments, Federal
and State.... The President’s plan, therefore, whether
intended or not, is an oath to encourage treason, and the plan
of the gentleman from Maryland is a plan to consummate
revolution.</p>

<p class='c000'>“... If his [the President’s] plan of making one
tenth rule in the States should succeed, then he will have
ready at hand the electoral votes of Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana,
Tennessee, North Carolina, and other States. He began
this business in Florida the other day, and the blood which
flowed at Olustee is the result of this scheme of personal ambition!</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'>“There is a sort of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">odium historicum</span></i>,” proceeded Mr. Cox,
“attached to all political test oaths.... They have
been the bane and foil of good government ever since bigotry
began and revenge ruled. You cannot make eight million
people, nearly all in revolt at what they regard as the detestable
usurpations of abolition, forswear their hatred to abolition.
You force by this oath the freed negro into the very
nostrils of the Southern man, whose submission to law you
seek.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“The conditions of pardon only inflame but do not quench
rebellion....</p>

<p class='c000'>“We may yet change the war from the diabolical purposes
of those in power, by changing that power to other hands, and
we are not ready to sever our Union while that hope remains.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Precedents and analogies from both ancient and contemporary
history were cited to demonstrate the folly of attempting
to hold the South in her place by force. These together
with censure of the Administration and criticism of the dominant
party in Congress made up a great part of Mr. Cox’s
very long speech.<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c010'><sup>[328]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Representative Boutwell, of Massachusetts, referring, May
4, to the remarks of his colleague, Mr. Ashley, of the committee
which reported the bill, observed that “since this rebellion
opened the Thirty-seventh Congress commenced its existence
and ceased to exist; that this Congress is now closing
the fifth month of its First Session, and that up to this time no
efficient, indeed no legislative steps whatever have been taken
by which the Executive is to be guided in the affairs of the
people occupying the territory that has been reclaimed from
rebel domination. Under these circumstances I think it due
to the country that this House, at least, should do nothing
which conveys any reflection upon his policy unless that policy
be clearly and manifestly in contravention of the Constitution
or of the well-ascertained and admitted principles of the Government.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When the populous parts of Louisiana were torn from rebel
domination, and the State of Arkansas indicated in various
ways the growth of a sentiment of loyalty and returning
allegiance to the General Government, the Executive had but
one of three courses before him: either to be silent, to govern
by military authority alone, or else to establish a civil government
or at least to take initiatory steps toward such establishment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>“It was unquestionably his right and duty, in the
absence of all legislative action, to govern these territories as
fast and as far as they were reclaimed by military power.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He defended both the President and General Banks, who
had for years been consistent advocates of liberty. He then
announced himself in favor of the bill of Mr. Davis.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Stevens],” continued
Mr. Boutwell, “maintains, as I understand, that these
States are out of the Union; that their territory is alien territory,
and that we are making war against alien enemies. I
do not admit either of these positions to be true. I feel quite
sure that these eleven once-existing States are no longer States
of the Union. The evidence on which I rely in support of
this position is found first in the declaration made by the authorities
of those States that they no longer exist as States
of the American Union. Next, we find that for three years
and more they have been resisting the authority of the Government
and have been carrying on a war against it. It is
absurd to say that States or people are a part of the Government
under the Constitution, and entitled to constitutional
rights and privileges, when they have been carrying on war
against the Government.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'>“Nor do I admit that the people in the rebellious States are
aliens. They are not of any other country, they are not of
any other legal jurisdiction, they are within the jurisdiction
of the Union. Three years ago they were a portion of this
Union, and although they have been carrying on a war, that
war has not thus far been successful, their independence has
not been acknowledged by us, nor has it been recognized by
any other nation. They, therefore, are not aliens. They are,
to be sure, public enemies, but they are not alien enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>“... These States as political organizations have
by their own will ceased to exist.... The existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>of a State is a fact within the control of the people themselves,
and cannot be influenced by any extraneous power whatever,
and therefore these States have by the will of the people
thereof as political organizations ceased to exist.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Admitting that the Government of the United States had
legal jurisdiction over this territory and over the people who
occupied it, it was an absurdity, he declared, “to say that
these States still exist and that the people there may without
our consent elect officers and send Representatives to this body
and Senators to the other branch of Congress.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To the taunt of the Democrats that the war had been
changed from a war to restore the Union to one for the purpose
of emancipating the slave, Mr. Boutwell replied by a denial
of the fact, but added that even if it were so, it was not the
first instance of the sort in human history. Up to 1774 every
American expected to preserve the old relations with England,
yet within two years Independence was declared. The pending
measure, he asserted, had not elicited marked attention in
Congress nor any great interest throughout the country, yet
in it lay the germ of a new civilization for half a continent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The limitation of the elective franchise to white males did
not meet his approval; for though the suffrage is not a
natural, it is the highest political, right. Where the suffrage
is denied to any large number of men, that community is
never free from the danger of intestine commotion.</p>

<p class='c000'>As South Carolina and Georgia were responsible for breathing
into slavery the breath of life after it had everywhere been
condemned, he would not have them again reappear in the
Union. Florida did not deserve a place in the Union and, by
giving the colored men local suffrage in that district, South
Carolina, Georgia and Florida, he would invite the blacks
thither as fast as they could be spared from the industries in
which they were elsewhere engaged. He would not ask to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>extend this principle to loyal Northern or to border States
with a negro population.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c010'><sup>[329]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Pendleton, of Ohio, made by far the ablest Democratic
argument against the proposed enactment. Its details as well
as its general policy, he said, required examination. After
stating quite fully the provisions of the bill, he continued:</p>

<p class='c013'>The gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Davis] facetiously entitles it “a
bill to guaranty to certain States whose governments have been usurped
or overthrown a republican form of government.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At last the mask has been thrown off. At last the pretenses have all
been laid aside. Three years of war have done their work, and the purposes
and objects of the Republican party have been at last acknowledged.
This bill is the consummation of its statesmanship the fruit of
its experience, the demonstration of its purposes. The gentleman from
Maryland introduced it; it is understood to be distasteful to some of
his party friends; but it is a party measure; it will be voted for by every
member of the Republican organization; it marks their policy of restoration;
it defines their ideas of Union; it interprets their construction of the
Constitution. As such I accept it. We have had double-dealing, hypocrisy
and fraud for the last three years. We have had false professions,
false names, and double-faced measures. We have had armies raised,
taxes collected, battles fought, under the pretense that the war was for
the Union, the old Union, the Union of the Constitution. These were
the catchwords for the patriotic people. In the secret council-chambers
of the party they were sneered at as devices with which to ensnare the
innocent, to deceive the ignorant, to coax the obstinate. They were to
be discarded as soon as, in the heat of war, in the exasperation of passion,
in the exultation of victory, or in the bitterness of defeat and disaster
and oppression, it would be safe to divulge the great conspiracy
against the Union, the constitutional confederation, the principles of free
government.</p>

<p class='c013'>That time has come. The veil is drawn aside. We see clearly. The
party in possession of the powers of the Government is revolutionary.
It seeks to use those powers to destroy the Government, to change its
form, to change its spirit. It seeks under the forms of law to make a
new Government, a new Union, to ingraft upon it new principles, new
theories, and to use the powers of the law against all who will not be persuaded.
It is in rebellion against the Constitution; it is in treasonable
conspiracy against the Government. It differs in nothing from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>armed enemies except in the weapons of its warfare. They fight to overthrow
its authority over them, while it seeks to destroy that authority
at home. They would curtail the limits of the jurisdiction of the Federal
Government; it would extend those limits, but change the basis and principles
upon which it rests. If revolt against constituted authority be a
crime, if patriotism consist in upholding in form and spirit the Government
our fathers made, those in power here to-day are as guilty as those
who in the seceded States marshal armed men for the contest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Revolutions move onward.” That is true. But call things by their
true names. Admit you are in revolution; admit you are revolutionists;
admit that you do not desire to restore the old order; admit that you do
not fight to restore the Union. Take the responsibility of that position.
Avow that you exercise the powers of the Government because you
control them; that you are not bound by the Constitution, but by your
own sense of right. Avow that resistance to your schemes is not treason,
but war. Dissolve the spell which you have woven around the hearts
of our people by the cunning use of the words conservatism, patriotism,
Union. And we will cease all criminations, we will hush all reproaches
for oaths violated, pledges falsified, faith betrayed. We will meet you
on your own ground, we will fight you with your weapons, and by the
issue of that contest, whether of argument or of arms, we will abide.</p>

<p class='c013'>Am I to be told that I misrepresent the Republican party? The gentleman
who has just taken his seat [Mr. Boutwell], an able and honored
member of that party, has said in your hearing, “If I could direct the
force of public sentiment and the policy of this Government, South
Carolina as a State and with a name should never reappear in this
Union. Georgia deserves a like fate. Florida does not deserve a name
in this Union.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The gentleman from Maryland felt that this charge could be truthfully
made. He sought to answer it in advance. He denied that the provisions
of the bill contravened any clause of the Constitution. Where
is the authority for it? Where is the authority to declare State governments
overthrown? Where is the authority to reconstruct them?
Where is the authority to appoint a governor; to call a convention to
remodel their constitutions; to fix the qualifications of its members; to
prescribe the conditions of their organic law; and until a <em>new</em> constitution
shall be made, to administer by Federal officers such parts of the
old constitution and laws as the governor, or the President, or Congress
may select?...</p>

<p class='c000'>At this point he quoted Madison on the guaranty clause, a
subject elaborated in the Senate by Carlile, of Virginia. Mr.
Pendleton observed that if slavery, which, with one possible
exception, existed in all the States at the time of the adoption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>of the Constitution, was not inconsistent with a republican
form of government then it was not inconsistent with it in
1864.</p>

<p class='c013'>And yet the advocates of this bill [continued Mr. Pendleton] propose
to deprive the States of power over the question of slavery, power over
their own indebtedness, power to regulate the elective franchise, and the
right to hold office, under the pretense that they thereby execute the
provision that the United States must guaranty a republican form of
government to the States.</p>

<p class='c013'>The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Boutwell] has shown how he
would execute it. South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida should never
again appear as State[s] or in name in this Confederation. Is their
exclusion a guarantee to them of a republican government?</p>

<p class='c013'>... If Congress may insist upon the three fundamental conditions
prescribed in this bill, ... by a parity of reasoning it ought to insist
upon their incorporation into the constitution of the States remaining
steadfast by the Union. If they are essential to republicanism in the
one class of States they are equally so in all.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>... Gentlemen must not palter in a double sense. These acts of
secession are either valid or they are invalid. If they are valid, they
separated the State from the Union. If they are invalid, they are void;
they have no effect; the State officers who act upon them are rebels to
the Federal Government; the States are not destroyed; their constitutions
are not abrogated; their officers are committing illegal acts,
for which they are liable to punishment; the States have never left the
Union, but so soon as their officers shall perform their duties or other
officers shall assume their places, will again perform the duties imposed
and enjoy the privileges conferred by the Federal compact, and this not
by virtue of a new ratification of the Constitution, nor a new admission
by the Federal Government, but by virtue of the original ratification, and
the constant, uninterrupted maintenance of position in the Federal Union
since that date.</p>

<p class='c013'>Acts of secession are not invalid to destroy the Union, and valid to
destroy the State governments and the political privileges of their citizens.
We have heard much of the two-fold relation which citizens of the
seceded States may hold to the Federal Government—that they may be
at once belligerents and rebellious citizens. I believe there are some judicial
decisions to that effect. Sir, it is impossible. The Federal Government
may possibly have the right to elect in which relation it will deal
with them; it cannot deal with them at one and the same time in inconsistent
relations. Belligerents being captured are entitled to be treated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>as prisoners of war; rebellious citizens are liable to be hanged. The
private property of belligerents, according to the rules of modern war,
shall not be taken without compensation; the property of rebellious citizens
is liable to confiscation. Belligerents are not amenable to the local
criminal law, nor to the jurisdiction of courts which administer it;
rebellious citizens are, and the officers are bound to enforce the law, and
to exact the penalty of its infraction. The seceded States are either in
the Union or out of it. If in the Union, their constitutions are untouched,
their State governments are maintained; their citizens are
entitled to all political rights, except so far as they may be deprived of
them by the criminal law which they may have infracted. This seems
incomprehensible to the gentleman from Maryland. In his view the
whole State government centers in the men who administer it; so that
when they administer it unwisely, or put it in antagonism to the Federal
Government, the State government is dissolved, the State constitution is
abrogated, and the State is left, in fact and in form, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</span></i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i>,
in anarchy, except so far as the Federal Government may rightfully intervene.
This seems to be substantially the view of the gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr. Boutwell]. He enforces the same position, but he
does not use the same language.</p>

<p class='c013'>... If by a plague or other visitation of God every officer of a
State government should at the same moment die, so that not a single
person clothed with official power should remain, would the State
government be destroyed? Not at all. For the moment it would not be
administered, but as soon as officers were elected and assumed their
respective duties it would be instantly in full force and vigor.</p>

<p class='c013'>If these States are out of the Union their State governments are still
in force unless otherwise changed. And their citizens are to the Federal
Government as foreigners, and it has in relation to them the same rights,
and none other, as it had in relation to British subjects in the war of
1812, or to the Mexicans in 1846. Whatever may be the true relation of
the seceded States, the Federal Government derives no power in relation
to them or their citizens from the provision of the Constitution now
under consideration, but in the one case derives all its power from the
duty of enforcing the “Supreme law of the land;” and in the other from
the power “to declare war.”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>The gentleman [Mr. Davis] states his case too strongly. The duty
imposed on Congress is doubtless important, but Congress has no right
to use a means of performing it forbidden by the Constitution, no matter
how necessary or proper it might be thought to be. But, sir, this
doctrine is monstrous. It has no foundation in the Constitution. It
subjects all the States to the will of Congress; it places their institutions
at the feet of Congress. It creates in Congress an absolute unqualified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>despotism. It asserts the power of Congress in changing the State governments
to be “plenary, supreme and unlimited”—“subject only to revision
by the people of the whole United States.” The rights of the people
of the State are nothing, their will is nothing. Congress first decides,
the people of the whole Union revise. My own State of Ohio is liable at
any moment to be called in question for her constitution. She does not
permit negroes to vote.... From that decision of the Congress
there is no appeal to the people of Ohio, but only to the people of
Massachusetts, and New York, and Wisconsin, at the election of Representatives;
and if a majority cannot be elected to reverse the decision,
the people of Ohio must submit. Woe be to the day when that doctrine
shall be established, for from its centralized despotism we will appeal to
the sword!</p>

<p class='c000'>The rights of the States, he said in conclusion, had reconciled
liberty with empire, the freedom of the individual with
increase of the public domain; by the proposed measure these
were all swept instantly away. It substituted “despotism for
self-government; despotism the more severe because vested in
a numerous Congress elected by a people who may not feel
the exercise of its power.... It maintains integrity of
territory but destroys the rights of the citizen.” Finally he
declared that he preferred separation to the unity which the
bill would create.<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c010'><sup>[330]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Debate was concluded by Henry Winter Davis, who rose
for the purpose of perfecting the pending measure by moving
as a substitute a bill essentially the same as that under consideration
in the House; from that plan, however, it differed
in two not unimportant particulars. First, it excluded what
his friend Mr. Cox had objected to, the rule of one tenth, and
required a majority to concur in forming a government. The
other softened the operation of the clause excluding officers
of the State and Confederate government, by saving merely
ministerial officers and the inferior military officers; so that
the exclusion merely affected persons of dangerous political
influence. By an arrangement with Thaddeus Stevens, instead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>of having a direct vote on his substitute, a portion of it
was proposed as a preamble to this bill, which, of course,
would be voted on separately and take whatever fate the
House might assign to it. With these observations Mr.
Davis said, “I offer this as a substitute, and move the previous
question upon it.” The substitute was agreed to, and
the amendment to the preamble adopted, the preamble itself
being rejected. By 73 yeas to 59 nays, the bill passed the
House, May 4, 1864.<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c010'><sup>[331]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This important measure authorized the President, by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint for each
of the States declared in rebellion a provisional governor, with
pay and emoluments not to exceed that of a brigadier-general
of volunteers, and who was to be charged with the civil administration
of such State until a government was recognized as
existing therein. As soon as military resistance to Federal
authority had been suppressed, and the people had sufficiently
returned to their obedience to the Constitution and the laws,
it was made the duty of the governor to direct the United
States marshal to enroll all white male citizens of the United
States, resident in the State, in their respective counties; and
wherever a majority of them took the oath of allegiance, the
loyal people of the States were, by proclamation, to be invited
by the governor to elect delegates to a convention to act
upon the reëstablishment of a State government, the proclamation
to prescribe the details of the election. Qualified electors
in the army could vote at the headquarters of their respective
commands. No person who had held or exercised any civil,
military, State or Confederate office under the rebel occupation,
and who had voluntarily borne arms against the United
States, could either vote or be eligible as a delegate. The convention
was required to insert in the constitution the following
provisions:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>First. No person who has held or exercised any office, civil or military,
except offices merely ministerial and military offices below colonel,
State or Confederate, under the usurping power, shall vote for or be a
member of the Legislature, or Governor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Second. Involuntary servitude is forever prohibited, and the freedom
of all persons is guaranteed in said State.</p>

<p class='c013'>Third. No debt, State or Confederate, created by or under the sanction
of the usurping power, shall be recognized or paid by the State.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the adoption of such a constitution by the convention
and its ratification by the voters of the State the provisional
governor should so certify to the President, who,
after obtaining the assent of Congress, was empowered by
proclamation to recognize the government so established, and
none other, as the constitutional government of the State;
from the date of such recognition, and not before, Senators
and Representatives as well as electors for President and
Vice-President could be legally chosen in such State. Until
reorganization the provisional governor was to enforce the
laws of the Union, and of the State before rebellion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The remaining provisions were as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>Section 12 declared that “all persons held to involuntary
servitude or labor in the States referred to, are emancipated
and discharged therefrom, and they and their posterity are
declared to be forever free. And if any such persons or their
posterity shall be restrained of liberty, under pretense of any
claim to such service or labor, the courts of the United States
shall, on <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i>, discharge them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Section 13 provided that “if any person declared free by
this or any law of the United States, or any proclamation of
the President, be restrained of liberty; with intent to be held
in or reduced to involuntary servitude or labor, the person convicted
before a court of competent jurisdiction of such act
shall be punished by a fine of not less than $1,500, and be
imprisoned not less than five nor more than twenty years.”</p>

<p class='c000'>By section 14 it was declared that “every person who shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>hereafter hold or exercise any office, civil or military, except
offices merely ministerial, and military offices below the grade
of colonel, in the rebel service, State or Confederate, is declared
not to be a citizen of the United States.”<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c010'><sup>[332]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On the following day the proposed measure came up in the
Senate, was read twice by its title and referred to the Committee
on Territories. On May 27 Mr. Wade reported the
bill with amendments, and on June 30 succeeding moved to
postpone all prior orders and proceed to its consideration.
His motion, however, was not agreed to, and it was not till
July 1, when the session was drawing rapidly to a close, that
its discussion began. To save time the amendments proposed
by the committee were voted down. Senator Brown, of Missouri,
believed that the subject of reconstruction could and
should be postponed to a later day, and offered for the bill, by
way of amendment, a substitute which declared incapable of
voting “for electors of President or Vice-President of the
United States, or of electing Senators or Representatives in
Congress,” until the rebellion was abandoned, the inhabitants
of all those States hitherto proclaimed in a state of insurrection.
That question he regarded as the necessity of the hour.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c010'><sup>[333]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Wade hoped this amendment would not prevail; there
was nothing, he asserted, in the argument that sufficient time
did not remain for its careful consideration, because it was
early and thoroughly debated in the House and had been
fully discussed by the Senate Committee. It was five months
on their desks and the attention of Senators had often been
called to it. On Republicans at least its consideration had
frequently been urged by himself. More than ordinary care
had been taken in this matter, and if the bill was not then
understood it never would be.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question would arise in the ensuing campaign. Senators,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>he said, had been refused admission to Congress, and
the principles on which they would be received should be declared.
They were announced in the bill which had passed the
House. It protected the Government against Confederate
sympathizers and guarded the interests of loyal Southerners
during the period of transition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The status of the seceded States was a question upon which
men differed widely. It was a question to be ascertained and
declared by Congress, “for the Executive ought not to be permitted
to handle this great question to his own liking. It
does not belong, under the Constitution, to the President to
prescribe the rule, and it is a base abandonment of our own
powers and our own duties to cast this great principle upon
the decision of the executive branch of the Government....
I know very well that the President from the best
motives undertook to fix a rule upon which he would admit
these States back into the Union. It was not upon any principle
of republicanism; it would not have guarantied to the
States a republican form of government, because he prescribed
the rule to be that when one tenth of the population would
take a certain oath and agree to come back into the Union
they might come in as States. When we consider that in
the light of American principle, to say the least of it, it was
absurd. The idea that a State shall take upon itself the great
privilege of self-government when there are only one tenth
of the people that can stand by the principle is most anti-republican,
anomalous, and entirely subversive of the great
principles that underlie all our State governments and the
General Government. Majorities must rule, and until majorities
be found loyal and trustworthy for State government,
they must be governed by a stronger hand....</p>

<p class='c000'>“... I hold that once a State of this Union, always
a State; that you cannot by wrong and violence displace the
rights of anybody or disorganize the State.” It was marvellous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>to him how gentlemen could fancy that States forfeited
their rights because more or less of the people had gone
off into rebellion, and he added, “This bill proceeds upon that
idea and discards absolutely the notion that States may lose
their rights and that they may be abrogated and may be
reduced to the condition of Territories. It denies any such
thing as that. No sound principle can be adopted that warrants
any such thing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Noticing the imposition of conditions on the admission or
on the readmission of a State, he remarked that this feature
of the bill would probably receive more criticism than any
other, and declared, “that the great Union party of the
country are altogether convinced that slavery mixed up in
a Government is so unsafe, so liable to overthrow that it
cannot be admitted as an element in a State government....
Therefore this bill has taken special pains to say
that the new government shall, in its constitution, proclaim
emancipation as a condition upon which it shall be permitted
to come into the Union.” There was a time, he admitted,
when it would have been deemed unconstitutional in Congress
to prescribe any particular principle for a constitution
when a State was seeking to come into the Union. “We
have done so, however,” he asserted, “in every State that
we have ever admitted,” and yet perhaps the question was
never entirely settled. “Would it be wise for us,” he asked,
“in admitting States back into this Union to permit them
to come with the very element that carried them out, with
the very seeds of destruction which had destroyed them
already? The framers of this bill,” he continued, “have
sedulously shut it out, and made it a condition on which the
seceded States shall come back that it shall be a fundamental
principle of their constitution that slavery is excluded.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The amendment of Senator Brown he characterized as a
bare negative; it did not inform the people of the seceded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>States upon what principle they were to be again admitted
into the Union.<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c010'><sup>[334]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Carlile, of Virginia, observed on entering into the discussion
that everything the bill proposed to do in the way of
remedying existing evils would be accomplished by adopting
the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri. The
provisions of the bill were not to be enforced and were not
to have any life until after the suppression of the rebellion,
and, therefore, there could be no pressing necessity for action
at that time, when a large majority of Senators expected in
three or four days to leave Washington for their homes.
Senator Wade interrupted him to point out that there was
provided a military governor whose duties could be performed
in any stage of the rebellion, from the time Federal forces
obtained a foothold in any State until it was in the Union
again. The Virginia Senator agreed with Mr. Wade as to
the extent of the President’s power in the matter, and in the
belief that once a State in the Union always a State; but the
bill, he said, not only maintained that State governments were
overthrown, but so far as it could do so, recognized and
assumed the right to overthrow the State governments if that
work was not already accomplished. If the President had
not the right to prescribe rules for the return of rebellious
States, where was the constitutional provision which authorized
Congress to do so? The title of the bill was an
insult, he declared, to the understanding of every enlightened
man in the nation and the bill itself one of the most revolutionary
that ever was proposed in a deliberative body claiming
to be the representatives of a free people.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question mooted in Congress forty years before, he
continued, was insignificant compared to the present. That
was a proposition to impose upon the inhabitants of a Territory
seeking admission into the Union a restriction upon their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>right of self-government when they became a State. After
one of the most exhaustive and learned debates that ever
graced the Capitol of the nation that assumption for Congress
was abandoned. It was permitted to rest as the settled law
of the land that Congress had no power to impose limitations
affecting the right of the people of a State to regulate their
own domestic affairs, even when sought to be applied to the
inhabitants of a Territory seeking admission to the Union.
This continued the settled action of Congress until reversed
at the preceding session by assuming to create an independent
State out of a portion of the Commonwealth which he represented.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No State can have a Republican form of government,”
he declared, “no State has a republican government, when
that government, no matter what are its provisions, is prescribed
to them by another outside of their limits. A republican
form of government must emanate and emanate alone
from the people that are to be governed. It belongs not to
the Congress of the United States; it belongs not to the
thirty-three States of this Union to prescribe for the smallest
State within its folds a constitution or form of government.
If you have a right to impose a limitation upon this power as
to one subject of domestic legislation you have a right to
impose it upon every subject. If you have a right to make
one provision of a constitution for a people you have the
right to make the entire instrument itself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>An interruption of his argument by Mr. Wade drew from
the Virginia Senator a query rather embarrassing to the Ohio
statesman. “Where,” asked Carlile, “does the Senator derive
the power to appoint a governor for a State, a State which
he acknowledges to be in existence, a State government that he
acknowledges to be in existence, a State government that he
acknowledges it to be his duty to protect and maintain? By
what provision of the Constitution does the Senator derive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>the authority to appoint for such a State an executive head?”
Mr. Wade replied that when the Constitution imposed the
duty of guaranteeing a republican form of government it
conferred the power to do so, and he in turn inquired, “Is
not that good law?” “No, sir,” answered Carlile, who proceeded:
“Now, Mr. President, I will satisfy the Senator himself,
I think; and really it is not necessary for me to attempt
to satisfy him, for he is too good a lawyer not to know the
meaning of the word ‘guaranty.’ What is it? Does the
authority to ‘guaranty to each State in this Union a republican
form of government’ authorize this Union to set up a
government, to create a government, or to make a government?
Is the maker of a note the man who guaranties its
payment? There is no man in the Senate who knows better
the definition and legal significance of the word ‘guaranty’
than the Senator from Ohio, and none, I am sure, is more
familiar, too, with the power that was intended to be conferred
by this provision of the Constitution.” After admitting that
he would bring the power of the Government to bear on a
faction who undertook to establish a monarchical form of government,
Mr. Wade put this hypothetical case: “Suppose
now that we have conquered them and the people are still
bent on their monarchy, shall we not guaranty a republican
government to them by putting one over them?” “If the
Senator be right,” answered Carlile, “Mr. Madison, the author
of the Constitution, was wrong.” He then quoted from
the forty-third number of the Federalist:</p>

<p class='c013'>“To guaranty to every State in the Union a republican form of
government; to protect each of them against invasion; and on application
of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature
cannot be convened), against domestic violence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In a confederacy founded on republican principles and composed of
republican members, the superintending government ought clearly to
possess authority to defend the system against aristocratic or monarchical
innovations.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>“The very case put by Senator Wade,” observed Carlile;
“and how it is to be done is stated:”</p>

<p class='c013'>The more intimate the nature of such a Union may be, the greater interest
have the members in the political institutions of each other; and
the greater right to insist that the forms of government under which the
compact was entered into should be <em>substantially</em> maintained.... It
may possibly be asked, what need there could be of such a precaution, and
whether it may not become a pretext for alterations in the State governments,
without the concurrence of the States themselves. These questions
admit of ready answers. If the interposition of the General Government
should not be needed, the provision for such an event will be a
harmless superfluity only in the Constitution. But who can say what
experiments can be produced by the caprice of particular States, by the
ambition of enterprising leaders, or by the intrigues and influence of
foreign powers? To the second question it may be answered that if the
General Government should interpose by virtue of this constitutional
authority, it will be, of course, bound to pursue the authority. But the
authority extends no further than to a <em>guaranty</em> of a republican form
of government, which supposes a <em>preëxisting government</em> of the form
which is to be guarantied.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sustained in his position by Madison’s commentary Carlile
resumed: “Now, sir, is the Senator answered?...
It is not claimed or pretended, I suppose, by the Senator from
Ohio, or by any advocate of this bill, that under any other provision
of the Constitution can a pretext be afforded for the
assertion of such a power as this bill proposes to assert.” To
Senator Wilkinson’s inquiry, what would the Government of
the United States do if the people of South Carolina determined
that they would not have a republican form of government
in that State, the Virginia Senator answered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I would have the Government of the United States do
nothing that it has not the power under the Constitution to
do, because I believe that the Government of the United States
is a Government of limited powers. I believe it to be its
duty under the grant of power in the Constitution to guaranty
the existence of a preëxisting republican government. That
government existed in South Carolina; the people have not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>determined, at least before this war they had not determined,
to have any other than a republican form of government.
We had recognized that government as a republican form of
government by the recognition of the State in all its departments
and the admission of all its national representatives.
It is made the duty of the Government of the United States,
not of Congress; and I desire to call the attention of the
Senator to that, because it bears upon his assumption for Congress
of power which does not belong to the Executive. It
is not alone the duty of Congress to guaranty a republican
form of government to the people of the several States; the
extent of that guarantee is not limited alone to the means
which Congress may employ; but the words of the Constitution
are ‘the United States shall guaranty.’ Hence every
department of the Government is equally bound; and Congress
being the legislative branch of course participates to a
greater extent in the discharge of that duty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After a discussion with Mr. Clark, Carlile proceeded in his
argument: “But, sir, the Senator from Ohio says the Union
is to be preserved. So say I. Upon what principle are these
States to come back into the Union? The people, says the
Senator from Ohio, will meet you with that inquiry. Sir,
when was ever such an inquiry suggested to the brain of any
loyal man in this Union? When was such an inquiry ever
put? Never until after a policy different from that which
characterized the commencement of this struggle was entered
upon by the party in power. All said the Union was to be
restored; all accepted the struggle as the use of the military
power of the Government in the restoration of the Union.
What Union? The Union of the Constitution. The Union
into which new States are to be admitted. It is not into ‘a
Union’ but into ‘this Union’ that the States are admitted.
What Union? The Union of the Constitution, none other;
and he who seeks to preserve the Union can only do it by an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>observance of the Constitution and of the constitutional means
to restore it, not reconstruct it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“... In this Union, created by this Constitution,
of limited and delegated powers, all prescribed and written in
the instrument, you propose to exercise your legislative power
by usurping the rights and liberties of the people, a power
which all the people you represent could not use or could not
exert without the destruction of the Union which the Constitution
formed. There is no power in this Government, there
is no power in the parties to this Government, there is no
power in all the States of this Union to prescribe a constitution
for the little State of Rhode Island. If every other State
in the Union, the adhering as well as the rebellious States, if
every man, woman, and child in them were to meet and prescribe
a constitution for the people of Rhode Island, they
would have no power or authority to do so under the Union;
and tell me where the people’s representatives derive the power
to do that which all the people in their collective capacity, save
the small minority which constitutes that State, cannot do?”<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c010'><sup>[335]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Carlile emphasized the fact that the bill under consideration
was not a war measure. In a running argument with
several Senators he showed both a ready and comprehensive
knowledge of the Constitution and made some telling points
against the bill as well as against the radical tendencies in
Congress. His speech was, perhaps, the very ablest delivered
by any Senator in opposition to the proposed measure. At
its conclusion Mr. Brown’s amendment was agreed to.</p>

<p class='c000'>An amendment offered by Charles Sumner to enact the
Emancipation Proclamation into a law was rejected by a vote
of 21 to 11. The Massachusetts statesman did not wish, he
said, to see the edict of freedom “left to float on a Presidential
proclamation.”<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c010'><sup>[336]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>The bill concerning States in insurrection against the
United States then passed the Senate by 26 yeas to 3 nays.<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c010'><sup>[337]</sup></a>
When the vote was taken 20 Senators were absent. On the
succeeding day, July 2, 1864, a message announced the disagreement
of the House to the Senate amendment and requested
a committee of conference. A subsequent motion of
Mr. Wade that the Senate recede from its amendment and
agree to the bill of the House was carried after some discussion
by a vote of 18 to 14, thus passing the bill on the same
day.<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c010'><sup>[338]</sup></a> The names of Doolittle, Henderson, Ten Eyck and
Trumbull voting with the Democrats in opposition foreshadowed
that division in the Republican ranks which afterwards
occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>The history of this famous bill from the moment of its
passage by Congress until the publication a week later of the
President’s proclamation concerning it is best related in the
Life of Mr. Lincoln by his private secretaries, Messrs. Nicolay
and Hay. These writers possessed an unusual opportunity
for ascertaining the sentiments of the President upon nearly
every question of public interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Congress,” says the diary of Mr. Hay, “was to adjourn
at noon on the Fourth of July; the President was in his room
at the Capitol signing bills, which were laid before him as
they were brought from the two Houses. When this important
bill was placed before him he laid it aside and went
on with the other work of the moment. Several prominent
members entered in a state of intense anxiety over the fate
of the bill. Mr. Sumner and Mr. Boutwell, while their nervousness
was evident, refrained from any comment. Zachariah
Chandler, who was unabashed in any mortal presence,
roundly asked the President if he intended to sign the bill.
The President replied: ‘This bill has been placed before me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>a few moments before Congress adjourns. It is a matter of
too much importance to be swallowed in that way.’ ‘If it is
vetoed,’ cried Mr. Chandler, ‘it will damage us fearfully in
the Northwest. The important point is that one prohibiting
slavery in the reconstructed States.’ Mr. Lincoln said:
‘That is the point on which I doubt the authority of Congress
to act.’ ‘It is no more than you have done yourself,’ said
the Senator. The President answered: ‘I conceive that I
may in an emergency do things on military grounds which
cannot be done constitutionally by Congress.’ Mr. Chandler,
expressing his deep chagrin, went out, and the President, addressing
the members of the Cabinet who were seated with
him, said: ‘I do not see how any of us now can deny and
contradict what we have always said, that Congress has no
constitutional power over slavery in the States.’ Mr. Fessenden
expressed his entire agreement with this view. ‘I
have even had my doubts,’ he said, ‘as to the constitutional
efficacy of your own decree of emancipation, in those cases
where it has not been carried into effect by the actual advance
of the army.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“The President said: ‘This bill and the position of these
gentlemen seem to me, in asserting that the insurrectionary
States are no longer in the Union, to make the fatal admission
that States, whenever they please, may of their own motion
dissolve their connection with the Union. Now we cannot
survive that admission, I am convinced. If that be true, I
am not President; these gentlemen are not Congress. I have
laboriously endeavored to avoid that question ever since it first
began to be mooted, and thus to avoid confusion and disturbance
in our own councils. It was to obviate this question that
I earnestly favored the movement for an amendment to the
Constitution abolishing slavery, which passed the Senate and
failed in the House. I thought it much better, if it were possible,
to restore the Union without the necessity of a violent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>quarrel among its friends as to whether certain States have
been in or out of the Union during the war—a merely metaphysical
question, and one unnecessary to be forced into discussion.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Although every member of the Cabinet agreed with the
President, when, a few minutes later, he entered his carriage
to go home, he foresaw the importance of the step he had resolved
to take and its possibly disastrous consequences to himself.
When some one said to him that the threats made by the
extreme radicals had no foundation, and that people would
not bolt their ticket on a question of metaphysics, he answered:
‘If they choose to make a point upon this, I do not
doubt that they can do harm. They have never been friendly
to me. At all events, I must keep some consciousness of
being somewhere near right. I must keep some standard or
principle fixed within myself.’”<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c010'><sup>[339]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A perusal of the preceding abridgment of debates shows
clearly that the bill was designed by Congress as a measure
of reconstruction and intended by many of its leading advocates
as a rebuke of the President. He was not, however, a
statesman whom even the deliberate censure of a coördinate
branch of Government could hurry into an act of rashness;
he had never been precipitate; indeed, the burden of radical
criticism was that Mr. Lincoln was provokingly slow. This
was the opinion which Charles Sumner expressed in confidential
correspondence with his English friends<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c010'><sup>[340]</sup></a> and which
Secretary Chase entered in the pages of his diary.<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c010'><sup>[341]</sup></a> The
President was, it is true, the most cautious of men, and the
fact goes far to explain the absence during his eventful
administration of even a single serious blunder; the discovery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>of a gross error of judgment seldom or never rewarded
the researches of his ablest critics. Though his modesty was
scarcely less than his prudence, he entertained a just conception
of the dignity of his office; long reflection upon constitutional
questions, which made him familiar with the extent
of executive power, taught him likewise to recognize those
limitations which the fundamental law had imposed upon legislative
action. Another characteristic which made him a
formidable adversary in every controversy was a constant
purpose to be always, as he expressed it himself, “somewhere
near right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The measure had been so long under consideration that
none of its provisions could have taken him by surprise, and
we are justified in concluding that when the bill was presented
for his approval he had already determined on his course of
action. Indeed there is evidence that some of his supporters
in Congress had written to their friends in Louisiana predicting
the very fate that afterward befell the bill. Their outline
of the President’s course admits of no other explanation than
that he had communicated to them his intentions respecting
it. The progress of the measure in the Senate was to be so
retarded that the adjournment of Congress would relieve him
of the necessity of exercising the veto, and that is precisely
what happened. In the very last hour of the session it was
submitted for his approval; his disposal of the bill on that
occasion has already been noticed; his approval was withheld
and Congress rose before the expiration of the ten days which
would enact the bill into a law without his signature. Though
an interested view had not been overlooked, he disregarded in
discharge of his duty every personal consequence of the important
step which he purposed to take. His hostility to the
measure had long been suspected, but when knowledge of his
failure to approve it had become a certainty the anger of the
more radical members of his party became extreme. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>had clearly been outwitted by the President and many of them,
eager for retaliation, returned to their homes meditating
schemes of revenge.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the present, at least, anything like adequate discipline of
Mr. Lincoln was not within their power, for the Baltimore
convention, which renominated him for the Presidency, had
adjourned nearly a month before. This at least was secure.
His election, though not entirely a foregone conclusion, was
reasonably assured; few of the discomfited members even
imagined the thought of injuring their party to embarrass the
President. It is easy to believe, however, that they intended
such criticism of his policy as would be consistent with party
success. But even here he resolved to dispute with them a
field of operations which they believed entirely their own. The
President, it is true, could not, even if so inclined, justify his
conduct in person before the voters of every State in the
Union; he could, however, and did forestall expected criticism
from Congressmen by publishing a proclamation vindicating
his “pocket” veto, thus destroying whatever hope remained
to radical Republicans of diminishing his popularity by ascribing
to him base or selfish motives for opposing the sense of
the Legislative department of Government. As on other
critical occasions so on this he found no precedent to guide
him, but with characteristic firmness proceeded deliberately
to establish one. When some of the Congressmen reached
their States they found their constituents already pondering
the proclamation of July 8, 1864. Its importance requires
that it be quoted in full:</p>

<p class='c013'>Whereas, at the late session, Congress passed a bill to “guarantee to
certain States, whose governments have been usurped or overthrown,
a republican form of government,” a copy of which is hereunto annexed;</p>

<p class='c013'>And whereas the said bill was presented to the President of the United
States for his approval less than one hour before the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine die</span></i> adjournment
of said session, and was not signed by him;</p>

<p class='c013'>And whereas the said bill contains, among other things, a plan for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>restoring the States in rebellion to their proper practical relation in
the Union, which plan expresses the sense of Congress upon that subject,
and which plan it is now thought fit to lay before the people for their
consideration:</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,
do proclaim, declare, and make known, that, while I am (as I was in December
last, when by proclamation I propounded a plan for restoration)
unprepared, by a formal approval of this bill, to be inflexibly committed
to any single plan of restoration; and, while I am also unprepared to declare
that the free-State constitutions and governments already adopted
and installed in Arkansas and Louisiana shall be set aside and held for
naught, thereby repelling and discouraging the loyal citizens who have set
up the same as to further effort, or to declare a constitutional competency
in Congress to abolish slavery in States, but am at the same time sincerely
hoping and expecting that a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery
throughout the nation may be adopted, nevertheless I am fully satisfied
with the system for restoration contained in the bill as one very proper
plan for the loyal people of any State choosing to adopt it, and that I
am, and at all times shall be, prepared to give the Executive aid and
assistance to such people, so soon as the military resistance to the United
States shall have been suppressed in any such State, and the people
thereof shall have sufficiently returned to their obedience to the Constitution
and laws of the United States, in which cases Military Governors
will be appointed, with directions to proceed according to the bill.<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c010'><sup>[342]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This unexpected publication was very differently received
by the various elements composing the Republican party; a
large majority of those acting with that organization still confided
in Mr. Lincoln; by the radical wing, however, he was
sharply censured. Notwithstanding the necessity for harmony
in the approaching campaign two of the boldest leaders, disregarding
every consideration of prudence, arraigned the
President in language which for severity was never surpassed
by the invectives of his ablest political opponents. In the entire
experience of the Republic no Executive had ever assumed
to reject those provisions in a legislative measure which he
disliked and adopt those that were acceptable. This is precisely
what Mr. Lincoln did, and the reasons for his action he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>declared to the people with a confidence which forcibly recalls
the direction of Andrew Jackson to the editor of his official
organ: “Speak out to the people, sir, and tell them that instead
of supporting me and my policy Congress is engaged in
President-making.” There was, however, this difference:
Abraham Lincoln addressed the people directly and ventured
no criticism of their representatives. Like his more impulsive
though not less popular predecessor he was not deceived in
the reliance which he placed in the patriotic instincts of the
multitude, which cared little for nice metaphysical distinctions;
by the masses of the people he was trusted to the
end.</p>

<p class='c000'>By Henry Winter Davis and Benjamin F. Wade, chief authors
of the bill, its progress had been watched with feverish
anxiety; when convinced that their labor was lost they became
greatly agitated and made no effort to conceal their
indignation at the conduct of the President. Their joint protest,
printed in the <cite>New York Tribune</cite> of August 5, was, perhaps,
the most bitter attack made upon Mr. Lincoln during his
Presidential career. Their fierce manifesto, addressed “To
the supporters of the Government,” declares that the writers
had “read without surprise, but not without indignation, the
proclamation of the President of the 8th of July, 1864.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The supporters of the Administration are responsible to
the country for its conduct; and it is their right and duty to
check the encroachments of the Executive on the authority of
Congress, and to require it to confine itself to its proper
sphere.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The paper then related the history of the bill. Its treatment
by the President, they declared, indicated a persistent
though unavowed purpose to defeat the will of the people by
the Executive perversion of the Constitution. They insinuated
that only the lowest personal motives could have dictated
this action. “The President,” they said, “by preventing this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>bill from becoming a law, holds the electoral votes of the
rebel States at the dictation of his personal ambition.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If those votes turn the balance in his favor, is it to be
supposed that his competitor, defeated by such means, will
acquiesce?</p>

<p class='c000'>“If the rebel majority assert their supremacy in those
States, and send votes which elect an enemy of the Government,
will we not repel his claims?</p>

<p class='c000'>“And is not that civil war for the Presidency inaugurated
by the votes of the rebel States?</p>

<p class='c000'>“Seriously impressed with these dangers, Congress, ‘<em>the
proper constitutional authority</em>,’ formally declared that there
are no State governments in the rebel States, and provided
for their erection at a proper time; and both the Senate and
the House of Representatives rejected the Senators and
Representatives chosen under the authority of what the
President calls the free constitution and government of Arkansas.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The President’s proclamation ‘holds for naught’ this
judgment, and discards the authority of the Supreme Court,
and strides headlong toward the anarchy his proclamation of
the 8th of December inaugurated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If electors for President be allowed to be chosen in either
of those States, a sinister light will be cast on the motives
which induced the President to ‘hold for naught’ the will of
Congress rather than his government in Louisiana and Arkansas.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The judgment of Congress which the President defies
was the exercise of an authority exclusively vested in Congress
by the Constitution, to determine what is the established
government in a State, and in its own nature and by the
highest judicial authority binding on all other departments of
the Government.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They ridiculed the President’s expressed hope that the constitutional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>amendment abolishing slavery might be adopted.
“We curiously inquire,” continue Messrs. Wade and Davis,
“on what his expectation rests, after the vote of the House of
Representatives at the recent session, and in the face of the
political complexion of more than enough of the States to
prevent the possibility of its adoption within any reasonable
time; and why he did not indulge his sincere hopes with so
large an installment of the blessing as his approval of the bill
would have secured?</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'>“A more studied outrage on the legislative authority of the
people has never been perpetrated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Congress passed a bill; the President refused to approve
it, and then by proclamation puts as much of it in force as he
sees fit, and proposes to execute those parts by officers unknown
to the laws of the United States, and not subject to the
confirmation of the Senate.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The bill directed the appointment of provisional governors
by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The President, after defeating the law, proposes to appoint,
without law and without the advice and consent of the
Senate, military governors for the rebel States!</p>

<p class='c000'>“He has already exercised this dictatorial usurpation in
Louisiana, and defeated the bill to prevent its limitation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Scarcely an expression of the proclamation, which was examined
in detail, escaped its share of censure or of ridicule.
To suppose that the President was ignorant of the contents
of the bill was out of the question, for it had been discussed,
they asserted, during more than a month in the House of Representatives,
by which it was passed as early as the 4th of
May. It passed the Senate in absolutely the form in which it
came from the House. Indeed, at the President’s request, a
draft of a bill substantially the same in material points, and
almost identical in those features objected to by the proclamation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>was submitted for his consideration during the winter
of 1862–1863.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “Protest” included also a sharp contrast between the
Executive plan of December 8, 1863, and that embodied in
the bill which had passed Congress. That measure, said
Messrs. Wade and Davis, required a majority of the voters to
establish a State government, the proclamation was satisfied
with one tenth; “the bill requires one oath, the proclamation
another; the bill ascertains voters by registering, the proclamation
by guess; the bill exacts adherence to existing territorial
limits, the proclamation admits of others; the bill governs
the rebel States <em>by law</em>, equalizing all before it, the
proclamation commits them to the lawless discretion of military
governors and provost marshals; the bill forbids electors
for President (in the rebel States), the proclamation and
defeat of the bill threaten us with civil war for the admission
or exclusion of such votes....”</p>

<p class='c000'>This arraignment of the President’s course concluded with
the language of admonition, if not indeed of absolute menace:
“The President has greatly presumed on the forbearance
which the supporters of his Administration have so long practised,
in view of the arduous conflict in which we are engaged,
and the reckless ferocity of our political opponents.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But he must understand that our support is of a cause,
and not of a man; that the authority of Congress is paramount
and must be respected; that the whole body of the
Union men of Congress will not submit to be impeached by
him of rash and unconstitutional legislation; and if he wishes
our support, he must confine himself to his Executive duties,—to
obey and execute, not make the laws,—to suppress by
arms armed rebellion, and leave political reorganization to
Congress.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If the supporters of the Government fail to insist on this,
they become responsible for the usurpations which they fail
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>to rebuke, and are justly liable to the indignation of the people
whose rights and security, committed to their keeping, they
sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let them consider the remedy for these usurpations, and,
having found it, fearlessly execute it.”<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c010'><sup>[343]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The authors of this remarkable paper were eminent in the
councils of their party and stood high in the estimation of
Union men everywhere. Senator Wade was distinguished
no less for his physical than for his moral courage—qualities
impaired somewhat, it is true, by a temper fierce and vindictive.
Henry Winter Davis, whose zeal for civil liberty
will constitute his best claim to the gratitude of
posterity, possessed literary gifts scarcely surpassed by any
statesman then in public life. Though treated with extreme
fairness, not to say generosity, by the President, he pursued
toward the Administration a course of consistent hostility.
This opposition, which even Mr. Lincoln’s tact could never
disarm, has been ascribed to disappointment at his failure to
obtain a place in the Cabinet. While the selection of Montgomery
Blair from his own State of Maryland may have been
a cause of estrangement, a sense of what Mr. Davis regarded
as public duty contributed, doubtless, to intensify this feeling,
which led him ultimately to think the President scarcely entitled
to courteous treatment. With the Ohio Senator the
pitiless maxim, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vae victis</span></i>, had an undoubted influence. Both
were gentlemen of wide experience and acknowledged ability,
and yet their vigorous and fearless arraignment of the President
revealed an astonishing lack of political sagacity. They
inquired, for example, on what foundation he rested his expectation
of an adoption of the constitutional amendment
abolishing slavery. The incorporation, soon after, of such
a provision in the fundamental law shows their want of
insight into the tendencies of the times. The fire of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>prophet, indeed, was present in the protest; his inspiration
was altogether wanting. Their absurd assertion that the
electoral votes of Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee were
the prime consideration with the President must be attributed
to the passion rather than to the reason of his critics, for
few men of that generation were more familiar with the
Constitution in all its relations. Better than most of their
readers they knew that the duty of counting such votes was
entrusted not to a possibly interested Executive, but to a
joint convention of both Houses. If the Maryland member
believed the President had committed the misdemeanors
charged and insinuated it was his duty to bring before the
House the question of impeachment. Far less than was expressed
in the protest would have been ground for investigation.
If tenderness to Lincoln, a weakness of which Mr.
Davis at least was never suspected, or a concern for party
welfare prevented such a step, then he was himself guilty of
a gross neglect of duty. Doubtless this consideration, together
with the want of moderation shown in the manifesto,
subjected its authors to a suspicion of insincerity. Indeed,
one does not read a dozen lines of their arraignment without
discovering the chief if not the sole cause of its publication.
“The President,” they say, “did not sign the bill ‘to guarantee
to certain States whose governments have been usurped,
a republican form of government’—passed by the supporters
of his Administration in both Houses of Congress after mature
deliberation.” In brief, the political departments of
Government had entered upon a struggle for power; Congress
had been defeated, and its discomfited leaders sought
to relieve their feelings by railing at the President.</p>

<p class='c000'>Except that it probably defeated the renomination of Mr.
Davis for Congress, their protest was followed by no political
result of moment.<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c010'><sup>[344]</sup></a> In it the mass of Republicans perceived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>only the seeds of dissension within their ranks. In this view
it was a source of delight to Democrats, though they felt little
sympathy with either the defeated bill or the purposes of
its chief authors.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>When Congress met in December, 1864, Mr. Lincoln,

of the twenty-five States participating in
the contest, had again been chosen President. In the struggle
for power he had refrained with his usual prudence from improving
his advantage over the Legislative department. The
annual message omitted all reference to the controversy occasioned
by his failure to sign, and his proclamation concerning,
the bill of Messrs. Wade and Davis; the question
of reconstruction was noticed in only the most casual manner.
A statement of the satisfactory condition of foreign relations
introduced the Executive communication; the subject of
finance received the consideration that its importance required.
The vast proportions and the efficient state of the
navy were mentioned as matter of congratulation. General
Sherman’s projected march of three hundred miles through
hostile regions was characterized as the most remarkable feature
in the military operations of the year. This with other
evidences of approaching disruption in the Confederacy led
logically to a summary of what had been accomplished toward
reorganization in those States already wrested from insurgent
armies. On this subject the message observed: “Important
movements have also occurred during the year to the
effect of molding society for durability in the Union. Although
short of complete success, it is much in the right
direction that twelve thousand citizens in each of the States
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>of Arkansas and Louisiana have organized loyal State governments,
with free constitutions, and are earnestly struggling
to maintain and administer them.”<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c010'><sup>[345]</sup></a> Movements in the same
direction, he said, more extensive though less definite, were
in progress elsewhere and should not be overlooked. No
plan of reconstruction was proposed, or even alluded to in
the message.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among questions beyond Executive authority to adjust
was specified the admission of members to Congress. In disclaiming
power over this subject he anticipated the criticism
of those Senators and Representatives who later in the session
ascribed to him a design to usurp important functions of the
Legislative branch of Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>From its concluding paragraphs we are enabled to collect
the sentiments of the President relative to his offer, a year
before, of a general pardon to designated classes upon specified
terms. In this connection he said: “But the time may
come—probably will come—when public duty shall demand
that it [the door open to repentant rebels] be closed; and
that, in lieu, more rigorous measures than heretofore shall be
adopted.” This seems to establish beyond question the fact
that Mr. Lincoln feared some measures more stringent than
he had been hitherto pursuing might be rendered necessary
by the failure of a policy of clemency to recall any large
number of insurgents to their obedience to the Constitution
and the laws.</p>

<p class='c000'>He ventured to recommend a reconsideration of the proposed
constitutional amendment abolishing slavery throughout
the United States, which at the preceding session had
passed the Senate, but failed to receive in the House the requisite
two thirds vote. Though the present, he reminded them,
was the same Congress and composed of nearly the same members,
their judgments were, no doubt, influenced by an intervening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>election, which, though it imposed on them no obligation
to change their views, made it reasonably certain that if
they did not submit the amendment to the States the succeeding
Congress would. He inquired, since its passage was
merely a question of time, whether they would not agree that
the sooner the better? The voice of the people, he added,
had for the first time been heard on that question.<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c010'><sup>[346]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As the President believed, the House had been so far converted
to his views that a joint resolution adopting the
amendment was passed early in the session by a vote of 119
to 56.<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c010'><sup>[347]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When Congress assembled the public was occupied chiefly
in watching the progress of naval and military operations.
The sinking of the <em>Alabama</em> and the capture of the <em>Florida</em>
practically ended Confederate privateering, for any expectations
based upon the escape of the <em>Albemarle</em> were frustrated
by the enterprise and daring of Lieutenant Cushing. One
army had been destroyed by Sheridan, another crippled by
Thomas. Tidings of telling blows inflicted by General Sherman
gave something like assurance of his safety. Though
not without heavy loss, Grant had forced Lee within the defences
of Richmond and Petersburg. Some of the lesser
Union advantages had, it is true, been offset by Southern
victories; signs of disintegration within the Confederacy,
however, were multiplying, and this condition forced upon
Congress the inevitable question of reconstruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>By unanimous consent of the House Thaddeus Stevens,
on December 8, offered resolutions distributing the President’s
message. To the Committee on the Rebellious States was
referred so much of it as was alleged to relate “to the duty
of the United States to guaranty a republican form of government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>to the States in which the governments recognized
by the United States have been abrogated or overthrown.”<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c010'><sup>[348]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing whatever in the message or the accompanying
documents related to any such duty on the part of the United
States, and the resolution assumed such a recommendation, no
doubt, for the purpose of bringing the subject before Congress.
One week later, Mr. Ashley, of Ohio, reported a
bill, on the subject of Stevens’s resolution, which was read
twice, ordered to be printed and returned to the Committee.
On January 12 succeeding Representative Eliot, of
Massachusetts, gave notice of his intention to offer at the
proper time an amendment to the bill in charge of Mr.
Ashley. No objection having been made, it was ordered
to be printed. This was, in fact, a substitute for the bill reported
by the Ohio member, and provided “that no State
engaged in rebellion against the Government of the United
States shall be allowed to resume its political relations with
the Government of the United States until by the action of
the loyal citizens within the limits of the same a State constitution
shall be ordained and established, republican in form,
forever prohibiting involuntary servitude within the State,
and guarantying to all persons freedom and equality of rights
before the law.” Its second section provided “that the State
of Louisiana shall be permitted to renew its political relations
with the Government of the United States under the
constitution adopted by the convention assembled at New
Orleans on the 6th of April, 1864.”<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c010'><sup>[349]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>That some of the more influential among the radical members
desired to avoid, if possible, a controversy with the President
may be fairly inferred from a letter of Charles Sumner,
written December 27, 1864, to Doctor Lieber. Among other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>things the Senator says: “I have presented to the President
the duty of harmony between Congress and the Executive.
He is agreed. It is proposed to admit Louisiana (which
ought not to be done), and at the same time pass the reconstruction
bill for all the other States, giving the electoral
franchise to ‘all citizens’ without distinction of color. If
this arrangement is carried out, it will be an immense political
act.”<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c010'><sup>[350]</sup></a> A communication to John Bright, written a few days
after the above, January 1, 1865, confirms this view. On that
occasion Mr. Sumner said: “The President is exerting every
force to bring Congress to receive Louisiana under the Banks
government. I do not believe Louisiana is strong enough in
loyalty and freedom for an independent State. The evidence
on this point seems overwhelming. I have discussed it
with the President, and have tried to impress on him the
necessity of having no break between him and Congress on
such questions. Much as I am against the premature recognition
of Louisiana, I will hold my peace if I can secure a rule
for other States, so that we may be saved from daily anxiety
with regard to their condition.”<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c010'><sup>[351]</sup></a> These passages explain the
amendment to the revived bill. Sumner was willing to remain
a neutral spectator of the debates on the recognition of Louisiana
provided the reorganization of the remaining States
should be made on the lines indicated by Congress.</p>

<p class='c000'>On January 16, Ashley’s bill was reached in the regular
order of business; by direction of the Committee on the Rebellious
States, it was offered as a substitute for the original
measure, from which it differed in one very important particular.
It expressly recognized the loyal governments of both
Louisiana and Arkansas. By unanimous consent the proposed
enactment, considered as an original bill, was offered for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>plan submitted by Henry Winter Davis at the preceding
session.</p>

<p class='c000'>Representative William D. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, would
amend the clause providing for the enrollment of “all the
white male citizens of the United States” by inserting the
words “and all other male citizens of the United States who
may be able to read the Constitution thereof.” Mr. Eliot
then introduced the amendment of which he had previously
given notice. By Representative Arnold another amendment
was offered to that of Eliot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Judge Kelley opened the debate by declaring that indemnity
for the past the victors in the war could not hope to
obtain; they could, however, demand security for the future.
In a very long speech he discussed the status of the negro in
the early days of the Republic; this portion of his address
was concluded with the remark that his amendment did not
contemplate that the entire mass of people of African descent,
degraded and brutalized by laws and customs, be immediately
clothed with all the rights of citizenship, but only those so
far fitted by education for its judicious exercise as were able
to read the Constitution and the laws of the United States.
This, indeed, he admitted, was only an entering wedge and
was to be regarded as an aid to their improvement; when
sufficiently advanced they were to be endowed with every
right necessary to their protection. A strong plea was made
to confer the suffrage on the colored man; otherwise, asked
the Pennsylvania member, how will it be possible to prevent
his subjugation? He would not rely on men’s abstract sense
of justice, for that had not prevented outrages in the past.
Justice should be embodied in laws and constitutions while
it was in the power of Congress to do so. That body was to
determine who should select delegates to the conventions
that were to frame governments for the insurgent States.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>The Union minorities in the South required the political support
of every loyal man in their communities. It was the
power, he reminded Representatives, not the spirit of the
rebellion that Federal armies were overthrowing. In conclusion
he declared himself in favor of conferring the suffrage
on “every man who fights or pays,” a doctrine which
he ascribed to Jefferson, in whose party he said he had been
trained.<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c010'><sup>[352]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Eliot, who spoke on January 17, regretted that he had
not been able to support the amended bill reported from the
select committee. Partly because of the interest, he said,
which his friend Henry Winter Davis took in the subject he
came to its consideration prepossessed in its favor. The provisions
of the measure passed at the preceding session, however,
were not then discussed. There were strong reasons for
action at that time which no longer existed to the same extent.
There was time enough on the present occasion, January,
1865, to make it more perfect and more practicable than the
plan offered by the committee.</p>

<p class='c000'>Entering upon an examination of the bill he declared that its
terms were peremptory; eleven States were in rebellion, and by
the first section the President was called upon to appoint for
each of them a provisional governor. Such appointments were
to be made when the measure became a law. Except in Louisiana,
Arkansas and Tennessee these appointments would be
not only useless but a needless source of expense, and though
section <em>fifteen</em> recognized the governments established in the
two former, the machinery of the bill would be applied to all
the States in rebellion.</p>

<p class='c000'>It imposed upon the several governors proposed to be appointed
executive duties which they could not assume until
the power of the United States had vindicated itself within
those States; there were other duties which they should not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>be required to perform. They were to see that the laws
which were in force in that section in 1860 should be faithfully
executed, with no knowledge on the part of the House
of the import of those laws. Why should Congress assume
responsibility for enforcing the black code? Why demand the
enforcement, he asked, of minute police regulations in States
where complexion appointed or reduced punishment? Other
laws were specified, such as those punishing the circulation of
books or writings advocating human rights, laws requiring
the removal from those States of free persons of color, prohibiting
them from engaging in business, and punishing by
the lash upon suspicion of false testimony and before conviction.
There was a law, he said, in one of those States requiring
the imprisonment of free colored sailors in her ports.<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c010'><sup>[353]</sup></a>
These provisions and many others of the same tenor were
contained in the statute books of those States in 1860 and
had been enforced. The penalty differed according to color;
offences when committed by a white man were punished in
one way, and when committed by colored men in another way.
The provisional governor was charged with the faithful execution
of such laws.</p>

<p class='c000'>The provision for the assessment and collection of taxes
he characterized as a remarkable proposition; they were to be
imposed without representation, without any persons at the
national capital to enlighten Congress on the subject; they
were to be laid without the knowledge of the parties concerned
or the parties to be affected.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sixth section, he continued, provided that every person
who should thereafter hold certain offices in the Confederacy
was “declared not to be a citizen of the United
States.” That, Mr. Eliot contended, was applying the punishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>before the offence had been committed. If Congress
declared that a man should for a certain offence be deprived
of citizenship, could he, then, be indicted for treason subsequently
committed?</p>

<p class='c000'>The question of electing delegates to constitutional conventions
presented a practical difficulty. Colored soldiers and
sailors in the service were made voters by the bill; but they
were not enrolled, they were not registered or credited to any
county or parish; they were aggregated. They had no legal
local habitation. They may have belonged to men owning
plantations in several districts. The bill did not designate.
With the white soldier the case was different, for he was
known to belong to a certain district. If colored men entitled,
because of military or naval service, to participate in the
choice of delegates should be out of the service before the
election occurred, and others should have taken their places,
which class could vote, those in the service of the Government
when the election for delegates took place, or those serving
when the bill passed Congress?</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether the difficulties pointed out were inseparable from
any bill on the subject, he would not undertake to say. But
in his judgment it would be unsafe for Congress to permit
a measure containing such provisions to become a law.
“Why,” he asked, “is it not more wise to take the States as
they shall present themselves for admission?” Arkansas had
acted in one way, Louisiana in another, and Tennessee was
proceeding in still a different manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding his objections to some features of the
Louisiana constitution, he favored her recognition. From
information derived from the highest sources, he had no
doubt that her Legislature would supply such deficiencies.
There were influences bearing on that body which he believed
could not be resisted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thaddeus Stevens inquired, “If Louisiana and those other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>States are in the Union, by what authority do we legislate
for their internal police?” This provoked laughter on the
Democratic side of the House. “If they are in the Union,”
answered Mr. Eliot, “just as Pennsylvania is, we ought not
to; but the difficulty is that they are not in the Union in that
sense, to that extent, thus fully. They are not out of the
Union territorially, and yet rebellion has overthrown their
governments for a time, and it is needful that the Congress
of the United States should intervene and should legislate.”
To this the Pennsylvania leader further observed, “I understand
the gentleman to say that they are partly in the Union,
and partly out. About how much are they in the Union and
about how much out?” This keen thrust was greeted by
more laughter from the Democratic members.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c010'><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On his motion to postpone further consideration for two
weeks Mr. Wilson demanded the previous question. Henry
Winter Davis appealed to him to withdraw the motion. This
Mr. Wilson declined to do, upon which the Maryland member
observed, “a vote to postpone is equivalent to a vote
to kill the bill.” By 103 yeas to 34 nays, however, further
debate was postponed till the 1st of February succeeding.<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c010'><sup>[355]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Though Representative Washburne, of Illinois, moved on
February 7 a further postponement of two weeks, the subject
was before the House again on the following day, when
it went over informally. Debate was not resumed till the
20th, when Mr. Dawes, of Massachusetts, took the floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Thirty-eighth Congress, he said, was in the last days
of its last session; a bill containing the main features of the
measure under consideration, though it passed both Houses,
failed at the preceding session to become a law; this circumstance
led him to make a careful examination of the subject.
The proposed enactment was not designed to invigorate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>army, the navy or the Executive; it was intended rather to
follow the army. It was intended to be applied to the condition
in which the army left the State. “it is an attempt,”
he said, “to gather up the ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">disjecta membra</span></i>’ of those States,
the broken and torn fragments of those communities, and out
of the chaos, as well as the ruins and <em>debris</em> that are left in
the march of those armies, to create a State capable of discharging
the functions, exercising the authority, and invoking
the recognition of this Government, and of the people under
which it lives....</p>

<p class='c000'>“... The bill proceeds upon the supposition not
only that there are States still existing, but that their old constitutions
and laws are still in full force and operation”; for
it imposed upon the provisional governor the faithful execution
of those laws in force when rebellion overthrew their
State governments, with the single exception of the provision
touching the enforcement of laws against slavery and the
mode of trial and punishment of colored people. Two remarkable
features of the bill, he asserted, were those empowering
the Executive in Washington, by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint governors in
every one of those States; then, no matter what provisions
for their election existed in the State law, the President was
authorized to appoint just as many and just as few officers as
he pleased. It might be a judge of the highest court of
judicature in the State; or it might be the humblest road-master;
it might be any one or all of the countless corps
between them. There was no provision in the bill that they
should be even residents of the State. “An army of officers,”
he continued, “in one paragraph of four lines, is here created,
subject to the sole authority and control of the President of
the United States.” In a Confederate report Mr. Dawes noticed
that there were 13,000 of them in a single State.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>“What,” he asked, “is the effect to be on the people over
whom, from every quarter of this Union, broken-down politicians,
men without place, foot-loose, are to be placed?
Sir, it is a reproach to our Government at this hour that
there are, about this capital and in the Northern States,
men who have been appointed to the judgeships of district
and other courts of the rebel States and Territories, drawing
quarterly the salaries of those offices, although they have
never been able, from the hour they received their commissions
to the present moment to set foot in the States over
whose courts they have been appointed. They could not go
one rod into the State, positions in whose highest courts they
have held for more than a year, without being hung on the
first tree.... But my friend [Mr. Ashley] has reported
a bill here which authorizes an army of thousands of
these officeholders to go into those States, with commissions
from this capital in their pockets, to lord it over the poor,
miserable inhabitants left behind the army there. These
rebel States may be thus converted into asylums for broken-down
politicians.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the language of indignation he entered into a criticism
of that policy which proposed to levy on the houseless
and homeless wanderers in the South, even then only
saved from starvation by the charity of the North, precisely
the same amount of taxes raised in 1860 when, by comparison,
the people were in a princely state. “Sir,” he
declared, “there is not an army, great as our army is, that
has power enough to accomplish that one single feat provided
for in this bill, for the very plain reason that there is not
money enough left in any one of these States outside the
Government with which to pay that round sum for one single
year.... This wise, efficacious policy is resorted to
in this bill to hasten on, I suppose, that other day mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>in it, when a majority of these people, molded by this process,
won by its benignity ‘shall voluntarily take the oath of
allegiance.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>He asserted, as Eliot had done, that the committee were
calling upon Congress to sanction all the black codes of those
States, save only that part which held men in bondage, and
that was allowed to enforce itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>The omissions, he asserted, were not less remarkable than
the provisions of the bill. The state of things established by
it was of indefinite duration. There was no provision for the
peculiar conditions existing there. “There is no attempt at
any adaptation of these laws to the new state of things consequent
upon the rebellion, and consequent upon our constitutional
action here. Not only is there no provision for the
new wants and necessities of this wasted and wretched people
who have been involved in the rebellion, but for that other
people who have now passed into freedom by our legislation,
and by the military consequences of this rebellion, who are
now without food, without subsistence, without knowledge,
and without opportunity to support and maintain themselves;
yes, sir, without homes, literally without where to lay their
heads.” There were 3,000,000 of these people, he added,
whose very existence was ignored by the bill; there was no
provision for schools; no provision for even a poorhouse;
no provision to teach them the arts of civilization, no provision
for kindling in them hope, for holding up before them
incentives to industry or securing to them its reward. Under
the operations of the bill they were the objects of free plunder;
they were to go forth to be hunted, despoiled and persecuted:
outcasts in the land.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the bill it was left in the discretion of the provisional
governor, he asserted, to terminate the system set over them.
He, as well as the army of officeholders under him, would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>interested in prolonging the period until the people had <em>sufficiently</em>
returned to their obedience. Before the initiatory
steps could be taken, even if the provisional governor were
willing, a majority of the people in each State must of their
own choice signify their loyalty by taking the oath of allegiance.
This made the matter dependent not upon the wish of
the loyal, but of the disloyal persons who constituted the
majority in those States.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plan, he further stated, ignored the principle that the
American people have the right to shape and alter for themselves
the rules by which they are to be governed. If the
matter was left in the hands of the disloyal, the time would
be far distant when Union governments would be instituted
in those States. The only wise policy was to establish a
government among the loyal; even though it might be weak
and inefficient at first, it would finally win back those who
desired to be reconciled. The other numerous class, those
who deserved to be hanged, were not provided for in the
bill. He was opposed to the provision which would turn over
to insurgents the loyal minorities in those States, and was not
less opposed to prescribing a fixed iron rule by conformity to
which alone out of chaos and anarchy might be made a loyal
government.</p>

<p class='c000'>Further, the bill proceeded upon the assumption that there
was no power in these people, except what was conferred on
them by Federal legislation, to establish State governments.
This he denied, and the authors of the proposed measure, by
offering to recognize the establishments otherwise organized
in Arkansas and Louisiana had conceded as much. In
the people, he said, and in them alone, existed the authority
to form an organic law subject to the constitutional
provision that the government should be republican in form.
He favored a recognition of the Louisiana government not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>because it was formed under the guidance of General Banks,
but because it was made by the loyal people of that State,
was acquiesced in by them, and because under it they were
building up a loyal government.</p>

<p class='c000'>Governors Hahn and Murphy and the officials chosen in
Louisiana and Arkansas who had been exercising their functions
for a year would be dispossessed by foreigners sent
amongst them by the President, who was empowered to do so
by the bill; bickerings, heartburnings and discontent would
follow any attempt to enforce this policy. Sooner or later
the people of those States must be allowed to form governments
for themselves, protected by the parental care of the
central authority.<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c010'><sup>[356]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Fernando Wood declared that he had listened with interest
and pleasure to words of conciliation for the South; little
but subjugation, devastation and annihilation had thus far
been heard from the party, the Administration and the people
represented by Mr. Dawes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The seceding States, Mr. Wood contended, had republican
forms of government which the treason of individuals did not
affect. Nor did individual crimes destroy the rights of the
people to regulate their domestic institutions. The forms of
government were the same as those that existed in the rebellious
States six years before. Even admitting that they
had not such governments in existence among them, the bill
did not provide a <em>republican</em> form of government for those
States.<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c010'><sup>[357]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>He was followed in opposition to the proposed enactment
by Mr. LeBlond, of Ohio, who discussed both the status of
the rebellious States and their form of government. His
speech on the former question added nothing of value to what
Representative Pendleton had said at the preceding session,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>nor did he enter upon so able an examination of the clause
guaranteeing a republican form of government as did Senator
Carlile on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Henry T. Blow, of Missouri, made an appeal for the admission
of Arkansas and Louisiana to prevent destructive military
raids into those States as well as his own. He would
support any measure that would restore them and strengthen
their loyal population. However, he did not favor negro
suffrage. His remarks scarcely touched the measure before
the House.<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c010'><sup>[358]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Joseph K. Edgerton, of Indiana, who followed in a lengthy
speech in opposition, said:</p>

<p class='c013'>The forerunner of this measure of legislation, so far as this House is
concerned, may be found in the territorial bill reported by the gentleman
from Ohio [Mr. Ashley] from the Committee on Territories in the
Thirty-seventh Congress, in March, 1862. It was aptly termed at the
time by the gentleman’s colleague from the Cincinnati district of Ohio
[Mr. Pendleton] “A bill to dissolve the Union and abolish the Constitution
of the United States.” The bill was summarily, if not indignantly,
rejected by the House without a second reading. But, sir, men
and events have since changed, if the Constitution of the United States
has not changed, and the stone of revolutionary reconstruction then
rejected by the master-builders in this House bids fair to become the
head of the corner. Then the Constitution was not altogether repudiated
as the foundation of our legislation; now revolutionary opinions and
plans override it as a thing of the past. Not many are there in this
Congress, and fewer there will be in the next, I fear, to do reverence to
the Constitution and obey its commands.</p>

<p class='c000'>The President’s proclamation of December 8, 1863, was
then noticed, and his usurpation of authority denounced; the
subject of the Louisiana government was also entered upon
and fully discussed. He next referred to the introduction
early in the preceding session of a resolution by Henry Winter
Davis providing for the appointment of a special committee
authorized to report a bill guaranteeing a republican form of
government to the rebellious States. The fate of that bill,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>President Lincoln’s proclamation concerning it, and the protest
of Wade and Davis were successively dwelt upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question between the President and his two Congressional
friends, Wade and Davis, was to Mr. Edgerton’s
mind “one between two usurping powers, the Executive and
the Legislative”; but, he continued, “I am free to say my
sympathies were with the legislators and not with the President.
Executive edicts have done more than acts of Congress
during the last four years to sap the foundations and
remove the landmarks of the Constitution.” The majority in
Congress, he asserted, by consenting to recognize the governments
of Louisiana and Arkansas, kissed the hand that smote
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>He opposed a recognition of the Louisiana government
because of its unconstitutional origin; Arkansas, he said,
differed from it in no material respect. After stating the
provisions of the bill he gave the following summary of its
effects:</p>

<p class='c013'>1. To take from the people of the State all power to initiate proceedings
to reorganize their own State government in harmony with the Constitution
of the United States, or even to prescribe the qualifications of
suffrage. The bill ignores the idea that there is any vital power in the
people to restore their State government—not only taken from them by
rebellion but kept from them by Federal power—....</p>

<p class='c013'>2. The effect is to exclude from the reorganization the entire white
population of the State who shall have held office or voluntarily borne
arms against the United States, or who shall not take the oath of July
2, 1862.</p>

<p class='c013'>3. To confine the right of suffrage and power of reorganization to
enrolled men and Federal soldiers taking the oath; and the law affords
no guaranty that even the enrollment shall embrace a majority of males
over twenty-one years of age. The majority required as a basis of action
is so many of enrolled persons taking the oath as, with the soldiers,
shall constitute a majority of the persons enrolled; that majority,
through defect or fraud in enrollment, may be not even one tenth of the
males of the State over twenty-one years of age.</p>

<p class='c013'>4. The effect is the absolute disfranchisement of eleven States and their
continuance in a state of war until they accept “the abandonment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>slavery,” as dictated to them by the United States, and until by organic
law they declare that all persons shall have “equality of civil rights before
the law” of the State; a well-seeming phrase of broad import; the
precise meaning of which I do not understand. A woman is a person,
a negro is a person, an alien is a person, and the right of suffrage is a
civil right. Does this high-sounding phrase of the bill mean that women,
negroes, and aliens shall have equal right to vote in a regenerated State
with white male citizens? What does “equality of civil rights before
the law for all persons” mean?</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>In fact and in purpose, then, the bill before the House is one to
abolish slavery in the United States, and to enfranchise and elevate
negroes, and to disfranchise and degrade white men; a bill to change
the social and industrial systems and internal policy of eleven States;
a bill to take from those States their inherent reserved constitutional
right to regulate in their own way their internal policy, not inconsistent
with the Constitution of the United States. It is a bill to punish treason
without trial or conviction; a bill to confiscate private property without
adequate compensation; in short, a bill to reconstruct States and make
State constitutions, when in truth no States or their constitutions have
been destroyed, or need reconstruction, unless by the voluntary action of
their own people.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>If this is a revolutionary Congress, you have a revolutionary power
to pass this bill; but if it be, as I am bound by my oath of office to
believe and assert, a Congress sitting under the Constitution of the
United States, and having no powers outside of or unknown to it, then
you cannot constitutionally pass this bill.</p>

<p class='c000'>He stated further that the bill “embodies a spirit and
purpose toward the Southern people which, if impolitic and
vindictive one year ago, when the bill first came before the
House, and when our enemy was far stronger and more
defiant than now, is still more impolitic and vindictive at this
time, when the minds of all good men are searching diligently
for ways of reconciliation and peace.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In conclusion he declared: “The Congress of the United
States, the legislative power of the Union, and the Constitution,
is asked by this bill to be the minister and executioner
of the great revenge of section upon section, States
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>North upon States South. For one, sir, I wash my hands of
the deed.”<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c010'><sup>[359]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The passages quoted convey no adequate idea of the able
and comprehensive character of Mr. Edgerton’s speech. It
was concerned not only with the subject under discussion,
but extended to a rather searching examination of Republican
professions in 1861 and the revolutionary practices of a later
time. It was marked throughout by perfect temper, but was
not on that account less effective. Any extension of time,
however, even twenty minutes, was denied him by the
majority.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this point, February 21, Ashley withdrew a motion he
had previously made to recommit the bill, and by authority
of his committee withdrew the measure which was the original
text and, in lieu thereof, introduced another. With this
substitution the pending amendments fell. Representative
Wilson desired his substitute to hold its original place.
Messrs. Wilson, Kelley and Eliot then modified their amendments
to the measure hitherto under discussion, and Ashley
explained his action in a brief address.</p>

<p class='c000'>He referred to the bill which at the preceding session
failed to receive the President’s approval. Since then he had
labored earnestly to conciliate members on his side of the
House who had scruples about the measure as it originally
passed, and, if possible, obtain a united vote in its favor.
For that purpose he consented to a compromise in providing
for the recognition of Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee.
The conditions were not such as he would prescribe if those
States stood alone. But in order to secure what he thought
of paramount importance—universal suffrage to the liberated
black men of the South—he consented to insert in the bill
which he had proposed a few days previously, a conditional
recognition of existing governments in the States of Louisiana
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>and Arkansas, and the government then being organized in
Tennessee.</p>

<p class='c000'>Disappointed in his efforts to win the coöperation of
Representatives who entertained practically the same opinions
which he did in favor of universal suffrage for the colored
man, and in favor of the early recognition of every Confederate
State with a population sufficient to maintain a government,
he now declined to offer his substitute. At the request
and with the concurrence of his committee the bill of the
preceding session was offered with some modifications. These
alterations were to strike out all that the bill contained to
which gentlemen had raised objection, in that it seemingly
authorized the execution of State laws as they existed at the
commencement of the rebellion. To make it perfectly clear
what the committee intended, they had inserted a provision
that the governor should execute only such laws as related to
the protection of persons and property; that all laws inconsistent
with the proposed enactment, and all laws recognizing
the relation of master and slave, should not be enforced. The
section which authorized the collection of taxes had been
omitted. He preferred not to commit himself to a recognition
of the Louisiana and Arkansas governments, unless
he could secure what he thought of paramount importance
in reorganizing the other States.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is very clear to my mind,” he asserted, “that no bill
providing for the reorganization of loyal State governments
in the rebel States can pass this Congress. I am pretty sure
that this bill and all the amendments and substitutes offered
will fail to command a majority of this House.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The course of debate had shown on the Republican side,
he said, so strong an individuality that no compromise could
bring them together on the great question of reconstruction.
Many on his side were capital leaders in the minority; they
were good at pulling down, but not so good at leading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>majorities and building up. He admitted their utter inability
to agree on the subject, and had consented to a conditional
recognition of certain State governments because he knew
they could be upheld by military power until the rebellion
should be crushed. Republicans were so nearly unanimous
at the preceding session, he said, that he felt the concessions
embodied in his substitute would enable them to agree without
much discussion or without consuming the valuable time of
the House so late in the session. His remarks not only
showed disappointment at the attitude of his party, but
clearly revealed the existence of a schism in its ranks.<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c010'><sup>[360]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Henry Winter Davis then rose to state the case for the
House. The bill, he said, to which amendments were pending
was the same as that which at the preceding session received
the assent of both Houses of Congress, with some
modifications to suit the tender susceptibilities of gentlemen
from Massachusetts: “first, the sixth section, declaring rebel
officers not citizens of the United States, has been stricken
out; second, the taxation clause has been stricken out; third,
the word ‘government’ has been inserted before ‘trial and
punishment,’ to meet the refined criticisms of the two gentlemen
from Massachusetts who suppose that penal laws would
be in force and operative when the penalties were forbidden
to be enforced; that discriminating laws could survive the
declaration that there should be no discrimination between
different persons in trial or punishment. There has been
one section added to meet the present aspect of public affairs;
that section authorizes the President, instead of pursuing the
method prescribed in the bill in reference to the States where
military resistance shall have been suppressed, in the event
of the legislative authority under the rebellion in any rebel
State taking the oath to support the Constitution of the
United States, annulling their confiscation laws and ratifying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>the amendment proposed by this Congress to the Constitution
of the United States, before military resistance shall be suppressed
in such State, to recognize them as constituting the
legal authority of the State, and directing him to report those
facts to Congress for its assent and ratification. With these
modifications, the bill which is now the test for amendment is
the bill which was adopted by this House at the last session.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He need not be at the trouble, he said, to answer the arguments
of gentlemen who at the preceding session voted for
the bill, and who, in the repose of the intervening period,
had criticised in detail the language and, not stopping there,
had found in its substance that it violated the principles of
republican government and sanctioned the enormities of those
laws with which slavery had covered and defiled the statutes
of every Southern State.</p>

<p class='c000'>With increasing severity Mr. Davis proceeded:</p>

<p class='c013'>That these discoveries should have been made since the vote of last
session is quite as remarkable as that they should have been overlooked
before that vote. But they were neither overlooked before nor discovered
since. The vote was before a pending election. It is the will of the
President which has been discovered since.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not at all surprising, Mr. Speaker, that the President, having
failed to sign the bill passed by the whole body of his supporters by both
Houses at the last session of Congress, and having assigned, under
pressure of events, but without the authority of law, reasons, good or
bad, first for refusing to allow the bill to become a law, and therefore
usurping power to execute parts of it as law, while he discarded other
parts which interfered with possible electoral votes, those arguments
should be found satisfactory to some minds prone to act upon the
winking of authority.</p>

<p class='c013'>The weight of that species of argument I am not able to estimate. It
bids defiance to every species of reply. It is that subtle, pervading epidemic
of the time that penetrates the closest argument as spirit penetrates
matter that diffuses itself with the atmosphere of authority, relaxing
the energy of the strong, bending down the upright, diverting just
men from the path of rectitude, and substituting the will and favor
of power for the will and interest of the people as the rule of legislative
action.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>All I desire now to do is to state the case and predict results from
one course or the other. The course of military events seems to indicate
that possibly by the 4th of next July, probably by next December,
organized, armed rebellion will cease to lift its brazen front in the land.
Disasters may intervene; errors or weaknesses may prolong the conflict;
the proverbial chances of war may interpose their caprices to
defer the national triumph; but events now point to the near approach of
the end. But whether sooner or later, whenever it comes, there is one
thing that will assuredly accompany it. If this bill do not become a law,
when Congress again meets, at our doors, clamorous and dictatorial,
will be sixty-five Representatives from the States now in rebellion, and
twenty-two Senators, <em>claiming</em> admission, and, upon the theory of the
honorable gentleman, <em>entitled</em> to admission beyond the power of argument
to resist it; for peace will have been restored, there will be no armed
power but that of the United States; there will be quiet, and votes will
be polled under the existing laws of the State, in the gentleman’s view.
Are you ready to accept that consequence? For if they come to the
door of the House they will cross the threshold of the House, and any
gentleman who does not know that, or who is so weak or so wild as to
suppose that any declaratory resolution adopted by both Houses as a
condition precedent can stop that flood, had better put his puny hands
across the flood of the flowing Mississippi and say that it shall not
enter the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are things, gentlemen, that are possible at one time and not
possible at another. You can now prevent the rise of the flood, but
when it is up you can not stop it. If gentlemen are in favor of meeting
that state of things, then do as has been already so distinctly intimated
in the course of this debate, vote against this bill in all its aspects;
leave the door wide open; let “our brethren of the South,” whose
bayonets are now pointed at our brothers’ hearts, drop their arms, put on
the seemly garb of peace, go through the forms of an election, and
assert the triumph of their beaten faction under the forms of political
authority after the sword has decided against them. I am no prophet,
but that is the history of next December if this bill be defeated; and I
expect it not to become a law.</p>

<p class='c013'>But suppose the other course to be pursued; suppose the President
sees fit to do what there is not the least reason to suppose that he
desires to do; suppose that after he has destroyed the armies in the
field he should go further, and do, as I think he ought to do, what the
judgment of this country dictates, treat those who hold power in the
South as rebels and not as governors or legislators; disperse them from
the halls of legislation; expel them from executive mansions, strip them
of the emblems of authority, and set to work to hunt out the pliant and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>supple “Union men,” so-called, who have cringed before the storm,
but who will be willing to govern their fellow-citizens under the protection
of United States bayonets; suppose that the fruitful example
of Louisiana shall spread like a mist over all the rest of the southern
country, and that Representatives like what Louisiana has sent here,
with such a backing of votes as she has given, shall appear here at the
doors of this Hall; whose representatives are they? I do not mean to
speak of the gentlemen now here from Louisiana in their individual
character, but in their political relations to their constituency. Whose
representatives are they? In Louisiana they are the representatives of
the bayonets of General Banks and the will of the President, as expressed
in his secret letter to General Banks. If you admit such representatives,
you must admit, on the same basis and under the same
influences, Representatives from every State from Texas to Virginia;
the common council at Alexandria—which has just sent two Senators
to the other House and has ratified the amendment to the Constitution
abolishing slavery in all the rest of Virginia, where none of them dare
put his portly person—would be entitled to send ten Representatives
here and two Senators to speak for the indomitable “Old Dominion.”
If the rebel Representatives are not here in December next you will
have here servile tools of the Executive who will embarrass your legislation,
humble your Congress, degrade the name of republican government
for two years, and then the natural majority of the South, rising
indignantly against that humiliating insult, will swamp you here with
rebel Representatives and be your masters. These are their alternatives
and there is no middle ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>To Mr. Eliot’s objection the Maryland member replied that
provisional governors “are appointed <em>now without law</em>, and
all we propose is that they shall be <em>under the responsibility
of law and subject to the control and confirmation of the
Senate</em>.” Having in mind this condition and the Executive
appointments to judicial places in Louisiana, Mr. Davis
added:</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir, when I came into Congress ten years ago, this was a Government
of law. I have lived to see it a Government of personal will.
Congress has dwindled from a power to dictate law and the policy of
the Government to a commission to audit accounts and to appropriate
moneys to enable the Executive to execute his will and not ours. I
would stop at the boundaries of law. When I look around for them I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>seem to be in a waste; they are as clean gone as the division fences of
Virginia estates from here to the Rapidan.</p>

<p class='c000'>After explaining the efforts of Mr. Ashley and himself to
remove the objectionable features of the bill as pointed out
by the two members from Massachusetts [Messrs. Dawes and
Eliot] he again criticised both with some severity, and continued:</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir, my successor may vote as he pleases. But when I leave this Hall
there shall be no vote from the third congressional district of Maryland
that recognizes anything but the body and mass of the people of any
State as entitled to govern them, and to govern the people that I represent.
And they who may wish to substitute one tenth, or any other
fractional minority, for that great power of the people to govern, may
take, and shall take, the odium. Ay! I shall brand it upon them that in
the middle of the nineteenth century, in the only free Republic that the
world knows, where alone the principles of popular government are the
rules of authority, they have gone to the dark ages for their models,
reviving the wretched examples of the most odious governments that
the world has ever seen, and propose to stain the national triumph by
creating a wretched, low, vulgar, corrupt, and cowardly oligarchy to govern
the freemen of the United States—the national arms to guaranty
and enforce their oppressions. Not by my vote, sir; not by my vote!</p>

<p class='c013'>If the majority of the people will not recognize the authority of the
Constitution of the United States, what does the gentleman say who
proposes these declaratory resolutions? That they shall come here
without it? No, sir; but I would govern them for a thousand years first
by the supreme authority of the Constitution which they have defied and
will not acknowledge. And govern them how? Not by the uncontrolled
will of this or any other President that ever lived, George Washington
included. I would govern them by the laws that in the hours of their
sanity they enacted, unaltered excepting so far as the progress of events
require that they should be altered; to the extent that we have proposed
to alter them in our bill, and no further. I leave their own rules for
their government, make the President appoint, under his official and
public responsibility, the officers who are to execute them; and if they
do not like to be governed in that way, let us trust that the prodigal will
come one day to his senses, and humbly kneeling before the Constitution
that he has vainly defied, swear before Almighty God that he will again
be true to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>That is my remedy for the grievance. That is what we propose....<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c010'><sup>[361]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>Though not his last word on the subject of reconstruction,
this was the last great speech of Mr. Davis in Congress on the
question of restoring political power to the rebellious States.
His alliance with Stevens, a somewhat unnatural union, had
brought him only disaster. As noticed in the preceding
chapter, he had been defeated for renomination in his district.
It is thought that disappointment hastened somewhat his
early death, which occurred toward the close of the year,
December 30, 1865. Though a touch of pathos may be discerned
in his concluding remarks, his was not the craven
spirit that was ready, in the words of Edgerton, to kiss the
hand that smote him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Representative Mallory, of Kentucky, on his motion to lay
the bill and amendments on the table, called for the yeas and
nays. The question being taken was decided in the affirmative;
91 voting to lay the bill and amendments on the table;
64 were opposed, and 27 did not vote.<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c010'><sup>[362]</sup></a> The Democratic
members were a unit against the measure, and in a body voted
to lay it on the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>The defeat of Davis now appeared complete, but the struggle
was not to be abandoned without another effort. On
the following day, February 22, 1865, Mr. Wilson from the
Committee on the Judiciary reported House Bill No. 740, to
establish the supremacy of the Constitution in the insurrectionary
States, with a substitute which provided that neither
the people nor the legislature of any rebellious State should
elect Representatives or Senators to Congress until the President
had proclaimed that armed hostility to the United
States within such State had ceased; nor until the people of
such State had adopted a constitution not repugnant to the
Constitution and laws of the United States; nor until by law
of Congress such State had been declared entitled to representation
in the Congress of the United States.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>The authority for this bill he professed to find in the fourth
section of Article I. of the Constitution, which reads as
follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>The Times, Places and Manner of holding elections for Senators and
Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature
thereof; but the Congress may, at any time, by law, make or alter such
regulations, except as to the Places of choosing Senators.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Wilson was somewhat embarrassed in defending his
bill. Dawes and Mallory exposed its weakness, and Representative
Kernan, of New York, believed it would put it in
the power of the Executive to say whether States should be
represented in Congress. Fernando Wood observed that
neither by that bill nor any other could either House of Congress
be deprived of the right to pass upon the election, returns
and qualifications of members.<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c010'><sup>[363]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Ashley at this point moved to amend the substitute
offered by the Committee on the Judiciary by striking out all
after the enacting clause and inserting the reconstruction bill
that was tabled the day before. When a point of order was
raised against its introduction the Speaker said that there was
an important amendment; the word “white” having been inserted
before the expression “male citizen,” thus restricting
the class to be enrolled by the United States marshal. Mr.
Kelley would amend it by striking out the word “white.” To
this the Ohio member had no personal objection; indeed, he
was abreast of Mr. Kelley in the matter of the suffrage: the
only restriction he would impose being that of intelligence.
Ashley appears, however, to have regarded himself as but the
mouthpiece of his committee by whose authority he had only
a few months before inserted a provision in his reconstruction
bill to recognize the Louisiana and Arkansas governments,
though he expressly declared on a subsequent occasion that he
was opposed to such recognition.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>By a vote of 80 to 65 the bill and its amendments was again
laid on the table. Thirty-seven members abstained from
voting; fourteen Republicans voted with the Democrats.<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c010'><sup>[364]</sup></a>
This action was taken on the 22d of February, 1865; the
session closed on the 4th of March following without any
further attempt to pass the bill. Before the vote was taken
Ashley stated his sentiments candidly. He wanted a record
made on the question. “I do not expect,” said he, “to pass
this bill now. At the next session, when a new Congress
fresh from the people shall have assembled, with the nation
and its Representatives far in advance of the present Congress,
I hope to pass even a better bill. Sir, I know that our
loyal people will never be guilty of the infamy of inviting
the blacks to unite with them in fighting our battles, and after
our triumph—a triumph which we never could have achieved
but for their generous coöperation and aid—deny those
loyal blacks political rights while consenting that pardoned
but unrepentant white rebels shall again be clothed with the
entire political power of these States.”<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c010'><sup>[365]</sup></a> The desire to obtain
negro suffrage explains the inconsistent course of Representative
Ashley throughout these debates.</p>

<p class='c000'>By a singular method of abridging history Mr. Blaine in
his <cite>Twenty Years of Congress</cite> passes without observation the
attempt to revive the “pocketed” bill, though it was during
its discussion that there was for the first time unmistakably
revealed the existence of a schism in the Republican party.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>IX<br /> <span class='large'>THE ELECTORAL VOTE OF LOUISIANA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>A preceding chapter has noticed the result of the
Presidential election of 1864. It was thought
proper, however, to reserve for separate treatment
the various questions presented by the participation in that
contest of Louisiana and Tennessee, two States reorganized
under Executive auspices. On the introduction by Mr. Wilson
of a joint resolution declaring certain named States not
entitled to representation in the Electoral College, the entire
subject came before the House soon after the meeting of
Congress in December.</p>

<p class='c000'>The proposed resolution was read twice and referred to the
Committee on the Judiciary. On the following day, December
20, 1864, it was reported, ordered to be printed and recommitted.
Under the operation of the previous question it passed
the House on January 30 succeeding. Its preamble, which was
favorably considered at the same time, declared that “the
inhabitants and local authorities of the States of Virginia,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, and Tennessee rebelled
against the Government of the United States, and have
continued in a state of armed rebellion for more than three
years, and were in a state of armed rebellion on the 8th of
November, 1864.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The joint resolution provided that these States were not
entitled to representation in the Electoral College for the
choice of President and Vice-President for the term of office
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>beginning March 4, 1865, and that no electoral votes from
them, relative to the choice of said officers for that term,
should be received or counted.<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c010'><sup>[366]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In a modified form the measure subsequently passed the
Senate, which proposed that there be stricken from the preamble
the words “and were in such condition of armed rebellion
for more than three years,” and that there be inserted in
lieu thereof, “and were in such condition on the 8th day of
November, 1864, that no valid election for electors of President
and Vice-President, according to the Constitution and
laws thereof, was held therein on said day.” In this amendment
the House promptly concurred, February 6, 1865.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Senate, February 1, Mr. Trumbull asked consideration
of the measure inasmuch as the electoral votes were to be
counted a week later. When the amendment was under discussion,
Senator Ten Eyck, of New Jersey, moved to strike
out the word “Louisiana” in the preamble, and added that
it was a matter of history that the State had reorganized, or
at least attempted to do so, and in the opinion of many, and
perhaps most, of her loyal citizens had reorganized as a State.
It was matter of history that they had elected State officers
and a State Legislature; that they had elected members to a
constitutional convention and framed a new constitution for
that State; that the Legislature passed a law authorizing the
choice of electors for President and Vice-President of the
United States in the last Presidential election, and that such
electors had met and cast their votes. “Under these circumstances,”
said Mr. Ten Eyck, “I think there is a striking distinction
between the State of Virginia and the State of Louisiana.”
The object of his amendment, he stated, was to
afford opportunity to a loyal people who had suffered all the
horrors of the rebellion, who had got the better of it, and put
it under foot, of coming back and resuming their place in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>councils of the nation. He did not then desire to make any
further remarks.<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c010'><sup>[367]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Trumbull then took up the discussion of Ten Eyck’s
amendment to the amendment. The electoral votes, he said,
were to be opened and canvassed a week later, and it was
known to all that no rules for action had ever been adopted
in that joint convention. He recalled the fact that in 1856
there arose a question over the counting of the electoral
vote of Wisconsin. A severe snow storm had prevented the
electors from meeting at their State capital on the day fixed
by law, and it was not until the day following that they were
able to cast their votes for President and Vice-President.
The question was not then decided, for Buchanan and Breckenridge
were the successful candidates in either event, and
were so declared.</p>

<p class='c000'>He believed a similar question was likely to arise when the
electoral votes would be counted on February 8. It was a
matter of public notoriety, he continued, that several of the
States included in the President’s proclamation of 1861, Arkansas,
Tennessee and Louisiana, had cast electoral votes.
There was a question as to their authority to do so in consequence
of the insurrection which prevailed there on the 8th
of November, when the election took place, and the House of
Representatives had passed the joint resolution declaring that
the votes of certain named States should not be counted. The
motion of the Senator from New Jersey would have the effect
of counting the vote of Louisiana. “If we decide to receive
the vote from Louisiana,” declared Mr. Trumbull, “it will be
a decision by the Congress of the United States that the State
of Louisiana was in such a condition as to vote for President
and Vice-President on the 8th of November last.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The alteration proposed by the Committee on the Judiciary,
said he, was for the purpose of avoiding any such committal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>on the subject as the motion of the Senator from New Jersey
brought up. If the preamble “is adopted and the resolution
passed, Congress will not have decided whether Louisiana is
in the Union or out of the Union, whether she is a State or
not a State.” It would be time enough, he believed, to decide
that question when it was presented to the Senate. No
statement of facts, he asserted in reply to Senator Howe,
accompanied the joint resolution from the Committee on the
Judiciary; it was a House resolution, and no report accompanied
it from the House Committee.</p>

<p class='c000'>A large part of Louisiana, he added, was on the 8th of November
preceding in the possession of a hostile force. In a
very considerable portion of the State there was no opportunity
to vote for President or Vice-President, and it might be a very
serious question whether, when half a State or the third
of a State was overrun by an enemy, an election held under
such circumstances and under the auspices of Federal guns
would be an election which would authorize the Congress of
the United States, when in joint convention it came to canvass
the votes for President and Vice-President, to count
ballots cast under such circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>In acting upon the resolution he did not mean to commit
the Senate one way or another relative to the organization
which had been formed in Louisiana. A decision to strike
out Louisiana would be to decide that her electoral vote would
be received and that on November 8th there was a State government
there. That he did not believe. No evidence, he
asserted, had been submitted to show how many votes were
cast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pursuant to an act of Congress the President had declared
the inhabitants of Louisiana in insurrection against the
United States. That proclamation had not been recalled.
“Sir,” concluded Mr. Trumbull, “until there shall be some
action by Congress recognizing the organization which has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>been set up in Louisiana, we ought not in my judgment to
count electoral votes from the State.” Whether Congress
would recognize it, he could not say; that had not yet been
done, and, until it had been, the electoral vote ought not to be
counted. He hoped, therefore, that Ten Eyck’s amendment
would not prevail.<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c010'><sup>[368]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Ten Eyck said it was with great diffidence that he
undertook to propose an amendment to the resolution; but
he held the doctrine that these commonwealths having taken
up their lot and part with their sister States when admitted
into the Union were not legally out of it; their governments
had been in abeyance; they had been overrun by the
feet of hostile armies, and many of their citizens, by usurpation
and in violation of their duty to their fellow-men and to
their God, had attempted to carry these States out of the
Union.</p>

<p class='c000'>That being his opinion, whenever these States, by the aid
of the General Government, or by the efforts of their own
people, or by the act of both combined, reëstablished themselves,
or set their State governments in action anew, and
had commenced again to revolve in their old orbits, he should
feel it his duty, so far as he was concerned, to extend to
them all the privileges and all the rights to which the loyal
people of a loyal State were entitled at the hands of their sister
States, whether upon the floor of the Senate or anywhere else.
It was to exclude Louisiana from the operation of the resolution
that he made his motion. As to those States manifestly
in the condition described in the preamble there was propriety
in passing the resolution.</p>

<p class='c000'>In reply to an observation of the chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, that the majority desired to avoid a committal on
this subject, Mr. Ten Eyck suggested that it would not, perhaps,
be amiss to insist that a committal should not be had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>against the interest of the State any more than in its favor,
and if his amendment involved the question whether Louisiana
was in a condition to perform all the functions of a
State government and to appoint State officers and Senators
and members of the national House of Representatives, the
same question was involved in the resolution and it would
be determined against her if the joint resolution passed as it
stood; for that would decide that Louisiana was in a state of
rebellion such as to deprive her of all the powers, rights and
privileges of a member of the Union. He was not prepared
to go to that extent.</p>

<p class='c000'>From various memorials, papers and documents that had
come into possession of the Senate, he continued, and were
published by its order, as well as from information derived
from other sources, it appeared that nearly, if not quite, a year
before an election for State officers was held in Louisiana and
a very large number of votes cast, about two thirds or approximating
two thirds of the largest number that had been cast
at any former election for State officers. Trumbull interrupted
to remark that no such statements had been received
by the committee. In those localities which voted, perhaps
two thirds of the former vote had been cast, but not two
thirds of that cast in the entire State. Ten Eyck replied that
the vote was 11,414; it was alleged that a large number of
former voters had entered the rebel army and a great many
had been killed. He might be in error concerning the whole
vote of the State. All these elections were free and uninterrupted
and without the interference of any military power
whatever. A person on the ground had declared that “no
effort whatever was made on the part of the military authorities
to influence the citizens of the State, either in the selection
of candidates or in the election of officers, and that the
direct influence of the Government of the United States was
less in Louisiana than in the elections probably of any State of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>the Union; that the officers representing the Government,
both civil and military, were divided, so far as they entertained
or expressed opinions, on the question of candidates and upon
the policy pursued in the organization of the government.”
If any military interference was exerted it was in aid of the
loyal people, and the civil authority was not at all in subordination
to the military.</p>

<p class='c000'>In view of the invitation that had been held out by the
Government to all the loyal people of those States to come
back and to endeavor to organize themselves anew and, when
they had gained sufficient strength, to present themselves
civilly and quietly at the ballot-box to choose their own State
officers and to choose delegates to form a new State constitution,
and when they claim the rights of other States, are
they to be met by the plea that upon certain out-bounds of
the State there may still be heard the tread of rebel feet? It
appeared by all the testimony that the population, the business
and the property of Louisiana were confined to the
cities and regions of country immediately bordering upon the
river, and that the residue of the State was very sparsely
settled indeed. That portion not submerged was used
for planting purposes. The wealth and population of the
State were confined within a small space and this contracted
area was chiefly under control of the United States. The
Presidential electors were chosen by the State Legislature,
and he did not think that method legal. That is why the vote
cast in the election did not appear in the testimony submitted
to the Committee on the Judiciary.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the withdrawal by the President of his proclamation
declaring the inhabitants of Louisiana in a state of insurrection,
if that were the test either the present incumbent or
his successor could keep the loyal people of those States from
returning to the Union during the remainder of his administration,
and, if reëlected, for the following term. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>even if every soul within the State were loyal and anxious to
return.<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c010'><sup>[369]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Howe announced his intention of voting for the amendment
of Ten Eyck, though for reasons very different from
those which influenced the New Jersey Senator. His support
would not be controlled by the number of citizens who participated
in the choice of electors. “I am governed,” said he,
“by the single fact that a statute of your own, existing at the
time of that election, declared that the people of that State
had the right to choose electors, and that certain of them
did participate in making that choice. The Senator from
Illinois [Trumbull] says but a small portion of the people
of the State participated in that choice. Your statute said
that all might. Does the refusal of a large portion or a small
portion of the people of a State to participate in an election
deprive the minority, if you please, no matter how small,
of their right under your statute?” Besides Louisiana he
understood that two other States had made choice of electors.
He would vote for an amendment to strike them out of the
resolution also.<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c010'><sup>[370]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Trumbull argued that a mere refusal to count the electoral
vote of Louisiana did not settle the question against the existing
organization. Wisconsin had a right to vote in 1856,
and nobody supposed otherwise; but many opposed the counting
of that vote. The State organization may be perfect and
yet its electoral vote rejected. If the Senate had refused to
count Wisconsin’s vote, it would not therefore have decided
that there was no such State. Ten Eyck promptly indicated
the weakness of this reasoning by pointing out that the preamble
of the pending resolution declared Louisiana in such
a condition of rebellion that no election could be had. Senator
Trumbull then put the case of a foreign enemy having such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>possession of Louisiana that no election could be held
throughout the State, and asked whether the Senator from
New Jersey would count the electoral vote of Louisiana when
not twenty men could have assembled in the State and voted
for President and Vice-President. If the Senate refused to
count her vote under such circumstances, would it decide that
the organization of the State of Louisiana was not to be recognized,
and was repudiated? Whether the organization established
in Louisiana was a valid one was a question which
would come before the Senate when they inquired into the
right to seats of those gentlemen who had presented themselves
as Senators.</p>

<p class='c000'>Replying to an assertion of Senator Howe, who was not in
his seat, Mr. Trumbull said he would like to see the statute
which gave Louisiana a right to vote in the Presidential election
of 1864. If any such existed it would be repealed by the
act of Congress which empowered the President to declare
the people of certain commonwealths in a state of insurrection.</p>

<p class='c000'>In referring to the objection of Mr. Ten Eyck that the
President, if he desired, could keep a State out during his
entire administration, Senator Trumbull observed that it
was only necessary for Congress to repeal the act upon which
the proclamation was based and then the proclamation itself
would fall.</p>

<p class='c000'>The refusal of a State to vote when she had an opportunity
to do so, said Mr. Trumbull, would be no reason for excluding
her electoral vote; but the people of Louisiana did not
have an opportunity unawed by hostile armies and unrestrained
by military authority to vote for President and Vice-President.
This, he said, was not the real point at issue; the
question for the Senate to consider and determine was whether
the Legislature of Louisiana was a lawful assembly, for it was
by that body that electors of President and Vice-President
were chosen in the election of 1864.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Mr. Trumbull believed that on November 8 about three
fourths of the area of Louisiana was in possession of the Confederates.
No person could have voted within that jurisdiction.
Eleven or twelve thousand was the largest vote ever
cast under these organizations; while the vote of the State,
when all her legal voters had the privilege of going to the
polls, was more than 60,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Ten Eyck stated that 51,000 was the highest vote
ever cast, and that the average was but 34,000. Trumbull
believed the Senate should concur in the House resolution
and that it need not commit itself one way or the other on
the Louisiana organization. The counting of the electoral
vote, which pressed for settlement, should soon be determined.<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c010'><sup>[371]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Harris thought the question of counting the votes
could be disposed of without committing the Senate or deciding
the matter of admitting Senators, as was done in the
case of Wisconsin in 1856. “If we count the votes of these
States,” said he, “the number of votes for Mr. Lincoln and
Mr. Johnson will be so many; if we reject these votes the
number of votes will be so many; and in either case these candidates
are elected.” By this or a similar declaration, the
phraseology of which was suggested by the precedent of 1856,
the question could be passed over. He asked the chairman
of the Committee on the Judiciary why Congress had not the
power to declare that New York should not vote. He opposed
the preamble because he did not believe it true, and he
denied that the local authorities in Louisiana, Arkansas and
Tennessee were in rebellion on the 8th of November preceding.</p>

<p class='c000'>When, on February 2, Senator Harris resumed his remarks
he observed that the question as to the power of Congress to
legislate in relation to the counting of votes for President
and Vice-President was not considered by the committee.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>Reflection had led him to doubt the competence of Congress
to legislate on the subject. That body could fix the time for
choosing electors and specify the time when they should perform
the functions of their office. That, he contended, was
the extent of the power of Congress over the subject. He
could find no authority in the Constitution, however, which
empowered Congress to pass a law, for the resolution
amounted to that, excluding any votes returned to the Vice-President.
Even if Congress had the authority it was inexpedient
to exercise it. Why should such extreme power
be exercised when the necessity did not exist? The result, it
was conceded, would be the same whether Congress counted
the votes of Louisiana, Tennessee and Arkansas or not. The
power was not contained in the Constitution. Those States
specified in the preamble did certainly rebel, but that Louisiana,
Arkansas and Tennessee were in that condition on
November 8 was at least open to question.<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c010'><sup>[372]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Doolittle believed that Congress by legislation
could provide in advance for the manner of counting electoral
votes; but that, he insisted, was very different from passing a
law which declared certain votes null and void after they
had been cast. That would be retroactive legislation. He
doubted the power of Congress over the subject of counting
the electoral votes, beyond that contained in the Constitution.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Congress,” he continued, quoting the fourth clause
of section one of the second article, “may determine the time
of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give
their votes; which day shall be the same throughout the
United States.” Pursuant to this provision Congress passed
the act of January 23, 1845. It was not for the president
of the Senate to open such as Congress told him to open, but
he should “open all the certificates” which were sent to him,
“and the votes shall then be counted.” Here, said the Senator,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>arose the grave question whether the president of the
joint convention was made the sole judge as to what votes
should be counted. The question practically came up in 1856,
but it was not then necessary to decide it, and it was waived
as not being essential to the result. On the present occasion,
1865, it was the same, the result of the election would not
be affected by the matter of counting or not counting the
votes of Tennessee and Louisiana; but it was not necessary
for Congress to assert a doctrine which in some future
time might be the very destruction of the Government, namely,
“That a political party in Congress can decide that certain
votes of certain States shall be canceled and others shall be
received. It will never do to set that precedent.” It would
be time enough, he said in conclusion, to meet the question
when it came up in the joint convention.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c010'><sup>[373]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Hale said that he had foreseen the difficulty and at the
preceding session had introduced a joint resolution directing
in advance what should be done; but the pressure of other
business, certainly not more important, prevented action
thereon. If the result of the Presidential election had depended
upon the votes of Louisiana, Tennessee and Arkansas
would the party have submitted against which their votes
had been cast? The rebellion then existing was caused, he
believed, by nothing at all in comparison with such a question.</p>

<p class='c000'>He denied the assertion of Senator Doolittle that Congress
had no power over the counting of the electoral votes. Suppose,
he argued, that, contrary to the constitutional provision,
a member of Congress or any officer of the Federal Government
holding an office of profit or trust happened to be an
elector, would not Congress have power to say that such vote
of Federal officer should not be counted?</p>

<p class='c000'>The framers of the Constitution, he declared, made the
most ample provision for just such a case. That instrument
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>confers on Congress the power “to make all laws which shall
be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing
powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution
in the Government of the United States.” Was not the
power to choose a President one vested in the Government
of the United States?</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Hale contended that then, when action by Congress
would not affect the result of the election, was the time to
settle the principle, and the precedent could be pointed to
showing the action and sentiment of Congress at a time when
there was no inducement to anything but an honest and
straightforward decision of the case.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suppose, he went on, that Nevada while in the territorial
condition had grown restless under her provincial state and
had sent certificates signed by her electors, would Congress
have no authority to say whether they should be counted?
In Washington’s first election the vote of New York State
was not counted. Now her Senator, Mr. Harris, doubted the
competence of Congress either to exclude, or refuse to count,
the votes of a State.<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c010'><sup>[374]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Doolittle objected to being quoted quite so strongly as
to say that Congress had no power over this subject. Congress
had power over the subject, but that power was limited.
When the Constitution says that the States shall do certain
things, such as directing the appointment of electors, that is a
limitation on the power of Congress over the matter. What
he maintained was that after the ballots had been cast there
was no power in Congress as a legislative body to declare
certain votes valid or invalid. The tribunal to which the
question was referred was the president of the Senate presiding
over the joint convention of both Houses. The power
in the first instance was with that officer to count or not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>count the votes. He was to decide whether they were from
States or from Territories.<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c010'><sup>[375]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Trumbull maintained that so far from being empowered
to decide disputes, the president of the joint convention
was not authorized to even count the votes. In the
practice of the Government the Vice-President had never
since the days of Washington counted the votes. The Constitution
says that he shall “open all the certificates and the
votes shall then be counted.” It does not state by whom,
but it does state that Congress has power to pass all laws
necessary to carry the instrument into effect. Congress, he
said, had exercised such power from the beginning.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no legal difference, he asserted, between South
Carolina and Louisiana. An individual trading in the latter
State, except under a particular license, could be taken up
and tried as a felon, and yet “we are told that we cannot
determine by act of Congress that they cannot elect a President
for us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Trumbull contended that if a question arose upon the
counting of the vote of any State, the joint convention could
not decide upon it. The bodies would have to separate and,
by passing a concurrent resolution, each act independently.
There was no popular election, he said, in the State of Louisiana,
but a body assuming to be its Legislature had appointed
electors of President and Vice-President. He did
not know whether the new constitution of Louisiana authorized
that method.</p>

<p class='c000'>The purpose of the Senate, he continued, in amending the
joint resolution of the House was to avoid declaring that the
people of Louisiana were on the 8th of November in a state
of armed insurrection. The preamble, even as it was
amended, did not wholly satisfy him; he believed that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>would be better pleased if it was altogether omitted. He was
informed that Tennessee had sent a vote as well as Louisiana.
The object of the committee was to settle the question before
the meeting of the joint convention.<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c010'><sup>[376]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Collamer thought that any law honestly intended
to carry into effect the provisions of the Constitution could
not be objected to. It could if it opposed or was inconsistent
with that instrument. There had been legislation on the
subject and additional action by Congress might be necessary.
For the resolution he offered the following substitute:</p>

<p class='c013'>That the people of no State, the inhabitants whereof have been
declared in a state of insurrection by virtue of the fifth section of the
act entitled “An act further to provide for the collection of duties on
imports, and for other purposes,” approved July 13, 1861, shall be regarded
as empowered to elect electors of President and Vice-President
of the United States until said condition of insurrection shall cease and
be so declared by virtue of a law of the United States.<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c010'><sup>[377]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>By Mr. Howard the question was regarded as of very great
importance not only as a precedent for the future, but “as
indicating the opinion of Congress on the subject, to use a
familiar term, of ‘reconstruction,’ or rather the rights of the
States in rebellion.” He believed it clear that the Vice-President
was to open the certificates and that the duty of counting
devolved upon the two Houses thus assembled. The act of
1792 seemed so to construe the Constitution.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The power of counting the votes,” he asserted, “and of
rejecting votes which are void for fraud or illegality, is, under
the Constitution, in the joint convention thus assembled.”
There was no doubt about it, he declared, because the Houses
convened for a great and protective purpose; they were exercising
the tutelary authority of the people, in protecting the
nation from the imposition of false and fraudulent ballots and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>certificates. The inhabitants of the States mentioned in the
proclamation of the President were public enemies; therefore
they had no political rights under the United States.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I look upon this measure as necessary,” continued Mr.
Howard, “as one form in which the sense of Congress ought
to be expressed against any hasty attempt to readmit these
rebellious States into the Union.” For one, he would require
the loyalty and friendliness of a majority of the people of the
rebellious States to be proved before readmitting any of them.
“The theory of our Government,” he went on, “is different
from that of almost every other government on earth. It is
that the will of the majority shall govern; in common phrase,
the majority of the people, but practically the majority of the
voting population.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In conclusion he declared that it was “the bounden duty of
Congress, in every case, to keep out of the Union every one
of these eleven seceded States until, in pursuance of our laws,
passed or to be passed, it has become perfectly evident to us
that there is in such a State a clear, absolute majority of its
voting population friendly to the Government of the United
States, and willing to proceed in the discharge of their functions
as a State; and, until that is done, you may be perfectly
sure, so long as I hold a seat in this body, my vote will be
given against any such proposal. I never will consent to admit
into this Union a State a majority of whose people are
hostile and unfriendly to the Government of my country. I
prefer to hold them in tutelage (for that is really the word)
one year, five years, ten years, even twenty years, rather than
run the risk of a repetition of this rebellion, which has cost
us so much blood and treasure.”<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c010'><sup>[378]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Ten Eyck, considering Louisiana as the strongest case, mentioned
it in preference to Arkansas or Tennessee, and, from a
paper furnished by a gentleman who was familiar with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>situation there, was able to state that “eleven thousand four
hundred and fourteen votes were polled at this election. The
average vote for ten years prior to the rebellion in these
parishes was fifteen to sixteen thousand.” The same parishes
cast their highest vote, 21,000, in 1860. He expressed
a wish to save Tennessee also from the effect of the resolution,
and declared that he did not see how the Vice-President-elect,
an alien, could preside over the Senate. Further, a vote in
favor of the resolution prejudged the case of the Senators and
the legality of the Legislature which sent them.<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c010'><sup>[379]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Pomeroy did not suppose that States unrepresented
in either House could be represented in the Electoral College.
He criticised the correctness of the preamble so far as it related
to Arkansas. The rebel governor as well as the rebel
legislature, he said, was driven out long ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Arkansas,” he continued, “has not voted at all in the
Presidential election.... Under the instructions and
impressions that the members from Arkansas received here
last session, they distinctly understood that States not represented
in either branch of Congress would have no right to
vote at the Presidential election. They returned to Arkansas
and so reported, and they never had any election; there are no
votes here from that State. They have been in suspense
awaiting the action of Congress.” The resolution itself did
not, of course, affect Arkansas, for there were no votes from
that State to be counted.<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c010'><sup>[380]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Cowan, probably adopting a hint dropped by Senator
Ten Eyck, noticed the fact that the proclamation of January
1, 1863, exempted from its operations thirteen named parishes
of Louisiana because no rebellion existed in them. The
validity of that decree had been recognized, while the proclamation
of December 8 following invited the people of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>Louisiana and other States to resume their rights. The question
was whether the arrangements of the President were to
be executed in good faith.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the duty of the Executive, he continued, “to put
down this rebellion, to relieve the people from its oppression,
and to restore them precisely to where they were when the
rebellion found them. If that is done, in ten days after his
proclamation, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo instanti</span></i>, the people resume their rights and
functions; and in this case I understand they are not only in
possession of the right, but are actually in the enjoyment of
it, having a regularly organized government with all the machinery
necessary and proper to a government.” He believed
that men and money were furnished the President to
sustain State governments and make them supreme within
their own limits.</p>

<p class='c000'>Concluding this portion of his remarks he said: “Mr.
President, this involves a direct conflict between the Legislative
and Executive bodies of this Government, and at this
time I am of opinion that we cannot afford to enter into that
conflict.”<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c010'><sup>[381]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Powell, of Kentucky, said that when it was asserted
that General Banks did not interfere in the Louisiana election
the statement was not true, for there could be no greater interference
in the elections of a State than to alter the qualifications
of voters. He declared himself “opposed to admitting
on this floor persons who are elected under the bayonet influence
in any way whatever. I very well know that there
was no free expression of the people of Louisiana in these
elections. I know that they but obeyed the behests of the
military, whatever commanders may say about it....
But for its tragical results upon republican liberty it [the
election] would be the greatest of farces.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Kentucky member believed that the rebellious States
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>were still in the Union, and when a majority of the people
in any of them returned to loyalty, when their governments
were organized, their Senators and Representatives should be
received.<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c010'><sup>[382]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Cowan, entering again into the discussion, said: “We are
bound by the Constitution to preserve the Union and to preserve
the rights of the people under the Union; not merely
the rights of a majority, but the rights of the people, of all
the people, and of any number of the people however small.
What are we to do? A minority of the people come forward
and say, ‘If you aid us for a while we can preserve this State
and keep her in the Union.’ ‘But no,’ according to the doctrine
advanced here, ‘there must be a majority of you
before we can recognize you as in the Union.’...
That will be very poor encouragement for the loyal men of the
rebel States to try and bring back their people to reason.”
The Pennsylvania Senator was one of the few who adhered
to the opinion that the masses of men at the South
were not disloyal; that it was a leaders’ rebellion.<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c010'><sup>[383]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Sherman, of Ohio, described the scene in the joint convention
of 1856 when Humphrey Marshall wanted to speak
and Mr. Mason, president of the Senate, refused to recognize
him. Speaker Banks, however, did recognize him; upon this,
Mason and others left the convention, and confusion ensued;
that, Mr. Sherman believed, was a reason why the resolution
should be disposed of.<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c010'><sup>[384]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Wade said: “About a year ago Congress, anticipating
that such questions as this might arise, in my judgment very
wisely framed a law and passed it through both branches with
the hope of settling this matter in advance. That law was
made upon great deliberation in both bodies of Congress:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>it received a very large vote in each House. It was very
proper in my judgment that Congress should fix the matter
then, because everybody could anticipate that a question of
the most serious danger to the Republic might arise in the
then approaching Presidential election, which might endanger
the stability of our Union, and which might under certain circumstances
precipitate these Northern States into a civil war.
Apprehending that such a question might arise, Congress
wisely, in my judgment, provided against it; but the President
did not agree with them, and he vetoed their bill, leaving
the question open with all its dangers, which, thank God,
have not arisen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The President, added Mr. Wade, chose to pocket the bill,
“and, as I suppose, he did it in defence of the proclamation
which he had put forth, declaring that whenever a tenth part
of the people of a State would come back, he would recognize
them as the State and as part and parcel of this Government—a
proposition which, with all my respect for the Chief
Magistrate, I am bound to say is the most absurd and impracticable
that ever haunted the imagination of a statesman....
And I must say of that proclamation of the
President that it was the most contentious, the most anarchical,
the most dangerous proposition that was ever put
forth for the government of a free people.</p>

<p class='c000'>“... I had a conversation with the now Vice-President-elect
of the United States on that subject, and with
other gentlemen on the Union side in the Southern States,
and I do not know of one of them who was not filled with the
deepest apprehension that if this principle should prevail they
would be annihilated by the nine tenths.”<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c010'><sup>[385]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As to permitting citizens of Louisiana who were serving
in the army and navy to vote in the election of February 22,
1864, Mr. Doolittle observed: “We have done the same thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>in Wisconsin, in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in New York, all
growing out of exigencies which have occurred since this
rebellion began, passing laws, authorizing men, although in
the Army of the United States, still to take part in the elections,
providing that they should not be deprived of their
rights of citizenship because they had enlisted in the Army to
bear all the sacrifices which are necessary to defend their
country in this struggle. And, sir, I maintain that there
was nothing wrong in this.”<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c010'><sup>[386]</sup></a> Even if it were wrong, only
808 soldiers, he asserted, participated in the election. A
separate registry of this vote had been kept by General Banks.
So far, therefore, from being a military usurpation it was an
attempt of the President to lay down the military power.
This he was endeavoring in good faith to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a somewhat excited defence of the Administration
by Senator Doolittle, and severe attacks on both President
Lincoln and General Banks by Mr. Powell and others, Ten
Eyck’s motion to strike out Louisiana from the joint resolution
was defeated, February 3, 1865, by a vote of 22 to 16.<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c010'><sup>[387]</sup></a>
Lane’s motion immediately after to strike out the preamble,
which would leave only an unmeaning resolution, was lost by
a vote of 30 nays to 12 yeas.<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c010'><sup>[388]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Harris proposed to amend Mr. Collamer’s substitute
by resolving, “That it is inexpedient to determine the
question as to the validity of the election of electors in the
said States of Tennessee and Louisiana, and that in counting
the votes for President and Vice-President the result be declared
as it would stand if the votes of the said States were
counted, and also as it would stand if the votes of the said
States were excluded, such result being the same in either
case.” By nearly the same majority this proposition also was
voted down without much discussion.<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c010'><sup>[389]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>Reverdy Johnson, who favored the House resolution as
amended by the Committee on the Judiciary, did not think
the rebellious States were out of the Union, and asserted that
there was no power in any branch of Government to declare
war against a State. Referring to the Whiskey Insurrection
in Washington’s administration, he said that Congress passed
no act declaring it at an end. The President declared it. It
ended itself. The insurrectionists laid down their arms, and
expressed willingness to yield obedience to the United States;
that ended the insurrection and disbanded the Federal forces,
“and that happening, the State of Pennsylvania, every part
of it, stood exactly in the relation, for all purposes, in which
the State and every part of it stood before the insurrection
was commenced.”<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c010'><sup>[390]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Collamer said that the real point in Senator Johnson’s
argument was whether Congress had anything to do in the
reorganization or reëstablishment of those States. Mr.
Johnson, continued the Senator from Vermont, seemed to
think not. On resuming his speech, February 4, 1865, he
inquired: “When will, and when ought, Congress to admit
these States as being in their normal condition? When they
see that they furnish evidence of it. It is not enough that
they stop their hostility and are repentant. They should
present fruits meet for repentance. They should furnish to
us by their actions some evidence that the condition of
loyalty and obedience is their true condition again, and
Congress must pass upon it; otherwise we have no
securities. It is not enough that they lay down their
arms. Our courts should be established, our taxes
should be gathered, our duties should be collected in those
States; and before they come here to perform their duties
or privileges again as members of this Union, they should
place themselves in an attitude showing to us that they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>truly taken that position, and we should pass upon it; and I
insist that the President, making peace with them, if you
please, by surceasing military operations, does not alter their
status until Congress passes upon it.... I believe that
when reëstablishing the condition of peace with that people,
Congress, representing the United States, has power, in ending
this war as any other war, to get some security for the
future.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The guaranty clause, Mr. Collamer asserted, implied that
States were to be kept in the Union; it was inserted for the
security of the minority in a State, though there might be
but one man there to redeem Sodom. No one State could
discharge the United States from a performance of that obligation.
To keep it Congress, if it was essential to maintaining
a republican form of government, could abolish
slavery if that institution stood in the way of performing the
guaranty. Before restoring the States, he added in conclusion,
the President would need the assistance of Congress,
else how could he get rid of the confiscation act.<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c010'><sup>[391]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Collamer’s substitute, which shared the fate of the amendment
offered by Ten Eyck, could be construed only by an examination
of the President’s proclamation to ascertain what
States were in insurrection.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the preamble, which stated that four years earlier certain
designated States had rebelled, and on the 8th of November
preceding were in such condition of rebellion that no
valid election for the choice of electors of President and
Vice-President could be held there, Senator Pomeroy objected
that the rebel governor of Arkansas had been killed,
and the entire disloyal government destroyed. When the
election was held the real local authorities in that State were
Union men. It would not be true, as the preamble declared,
that these authorities were in rebellion on November 8. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>terms of the disloyal officials in Arkansas had expired by
limitation; the chief men in that government were not alive
to exert any influence if they were disposed to do so. It
was not true to say that they made war on the United States
on the 8th of November, 1864, or that they were then in
condition to do so. Since the rebellion began they never had
but one election.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomeroy’s amendment to substitute for “state of rebellion”
the word “condition” was carried by a vote of 26 to
13. The preamble, as thus perfected, declared that certain
States had rebelled four years before, and on November 8
were in such “condition” that no valid election was held.<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c010'><sup>[392]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Lane believed that for the protection of Union men
in those States a loyal government was indispensable, and
that it did more to demoralize the insurgents and to close out
the rebellion than any other act that could be accomplished.
It would be worth more than all the victories that could be
gained in the field.<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c010'><sup>[393]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Howe in closing the debate observed that four days
had been spent in discussing not the passage of the joint
resolution, but the reason to be assigned in its preamble for
excluding the vote of certain States. It belonged to the
legislatures of those commonwealths, he maintained, to declare
whether valid elections had been held there. He distrusted
that sort of legislation, and in conclusion said: “If you will
take hold of the question of the political relations of these
communities, and if you will tell what is the truth, and has
been the truth since 1861, that there are no State organizations
there, no State governments, I am with you. When you establish
that, you know what they may and what they may not
do.”<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c010'><sup>[394]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>By a vote of 29 to 10 the joint resolution was passed on
February 4. In the record the names of Cowan, Doolittle,
Harris, Howe, Lane of Kansas, Nesmith, Saulsbury, Ten
Eyck, Van Winkle and Willey appear in opposition.<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c010'><sup>[395]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>For the purpose of canvassing the electoral votes, both
Houses assembled in joint convention four days later, February
8, 1865. The Vice-President in discharge of his duty
proceeded to open and hand to the tellers the votes of the
several States, beginning with Maine. No one dissenting
it was agreed on a suggestion by Senator Wade to dispense
with the reading of everything in the certificate except the
result of the vote.</p>

<p class='c000'>When all the votes had been recorded, Cowan said: “Mr.
President, I inquire whether there are any further returns to
be counted.” The Vice-President replied in the negative.
To his former question Mr. Cowan then added, “And if
there be, I would inquire why they are not submitted to this
body in joint convention, which is alone capable of determining
whether they should be counted or not.” The Vice-President
acknowledged that he had in his possession returns
from the States of Louisiana and Tennessee, but in obedience
to the law of the land “the Chair holds it to be his
duty not to present them to the convention.” The Pennsylvania
Senator thereupon inquired whether the joint resolution
had been signed by the President, and was informed that
while the official communication of its approval had not been
received by either House, the Chair had been apprised that
the resolution had received the Executive approval.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cowan then suggested that, as a motion was not in order,
the votes of Louisiana and Tennessee be counted, and that
the convention determine the fact. Representative Cox immediately
recommended the reading of the joint rule under
which both Houses were then acting. On being directed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>the Vice-President the secretary complied with this suggestion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thaddeus Stevens did not think any question had arisen
which required the two Houses to separate, for that, according
to the language of the joint resolution, could only occur
upon the reading of those returns which had been opened
by the president of the convention.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Cowan did what he could to bring the question before
the two Houses, and failing, withdrew it. The result, after
some further effort to call up the returns from Louisiana and
Tennessee, was then announced. The tellers reported that for
President of the United States Abraham Lincoln had received
212, and George B. McClellan 21 votes; that for
Vice-President Andrew Johnson had received 212, and George
H. Pendleton 21 votes.<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c010'><sup>[396]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On February 10 the president <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tempore</span></i> laid before the
Senate the following communication from Mr. Lincoln:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>To the honorable the Senate and House of Representatives</em>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The joint resolution entitled “Joint resolution declaring certain States
not entitled to representation in the Electoral College” has been signed
by the Executive, in deference to the view of Congress implied in its
passage and presentation to him. In his own view, however, the two
Houses of Congress, convened under the twelfth article of the Constitution,
have complete power to exclude from counting all electoral votes
deemed by them to be illegal; and it is not competent for the Executive
to defeat or obstruct that power by a veto, as would be the case if his
action were at all essential in the matter. He disclaims all right of the
Executive to interfere in any way in the matter of canvassing or
counting electoral votes, and he also disclaims that, by signing said
resolution, he has expressed any opinion on the recitals of the preamble,
or any judgment of his own upon the subject of the resolution.<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c010'><sup>[397]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Except for a brief speech by Reverdy Johnson this message
was received in silence by the Senate. Mr. Johnson commented
upon the extraordinary course of the President, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>duty, he said, was clearly to approve or to disapprove, not
virtually to read a lecture to the Senate as he had done. The
Maryland member did not doubt that the motives of the
President were perfectly correct and patriotic, but it was
not the first time, he asserted, that that had been done. The
bill for the reconstruction of the seceded States passed both
Houses by an overwhelming majority; but it was defeated
by the President’s failure to approve, and the adjournment
of Congress before ten days elapsed. In his manifesto or
proclamation he approved portions and disapproved others.<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c010'><sup>[398]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Short as this paper was, however, it was entirely characteristic
of the President. This little lesson in constitutional
law is only another proof that Mr. Lincoln possessed in an
eminent degree the faculty of seeing clearly through the
most intricate question. His disposal of this difficulty as well
as his reflections on Congress remind one of the facility with
which he straightened out for General Butler the liquor problem
at Norfolk. The succeeding chapter will describe another
phase of the controversy between the political departments
of the Government.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>X<br /> <span class='large'>SENATE DEBATE ON LOUISIANA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>At the opening of its second session, December 5,
1864, the Speaker of the Thirty-eighth Congress
laid before the House the credentials of W. D.
Mann, T. M. Wells, Robert W. Taliaferro, A. P. Field and
M. F. Bonzano, who claimed seats as Representatives from
the State of Louisiana. A petition, signed by numerous
citizens of that commonwealth, protesting against the admission
of these claimants, was referred at the same time on
motion of Henry Winter Davis to the Committee of Elections
in connection with their credentials, which had already received
the same direction. On the 13th this remonstrance
was ordered to be printed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Dawes on February 11 following reported that “M.
F. Bonzano is entitled to a seat in this House as a Representative
from the First Congressional District of Louisiana.”
Six days later he presented a report and resolutions from his
committee to the effect that Messrs. Field and Mann from the
Second and Third Districts, respectively, were also entitled
to seats. These reports with the accompanying resolutions
were laid on the table and ordered to be printed.</p>

<p class='c000'>No further action was taken on the question of their admission,
but on March 3, 1865, Chairman Dawes by unanimous
consent reported from the Committee of Elections a
resolution that there be paid to each of the Louisiana claimants
for compensation, expenses and mileage the sum of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>$2,000 and a like amount to T. M. Jacks, J. M. Johnson and
A. A. C. Rogers, claimants from Arkansas.</p>

<p class='c000'>The House, however, was not nearly so unanimous as its
committee. Mr. Washburne remarked that Congress, by
allowing at the last session the sum of $1,500 to one gentleman
who claimed a seat, had fixed a sort of rule in such
cases. That amount he would, probably, not object to paying
to the present applicants; but if large payments, such as the
compensation proposed by the resolution, were made to men
coming to the Capitol it was feared they might not soon stop.</p>

<p class='c000'>Representative Johnson, of Pennsylvania, believed that regardless
of their right to seats they should be compensated
because they had been encouraged to come; they appeared at
the Capitol, he asserted, with an honest expectation of getting
seats, and in an honest effort to restore popular government
to their States.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Dawes declared that they came not as adventurers but
under what they supposed was the policy of the General
Government; hence the favorable recommendation of the
committee. When he demanded the previous question,
Representative Brandegee moved to lay the resolution on
the table. Thaddeus Stevens asked to strike out the words
“claimants for seats.” To this the Massachusetts member
offered no objection. “I do not want to recognize the idea,”
added Stevens, “that anybody on earth thinks that these men
are entitled to seats.”<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c010'><sup>[399]</sup></a> This request, however, was denied,
and the resolution was then adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was during their three months’ sojourn in Washington
that one of the claimants, A. P. Field, committed an assault
upon Representative William D. Kelley, of Pennsylvania,
whom he regarded as the chief obstacle to their admission.
This occurrence, which took place on February 20 at the
Willard Hotel, was due, no doubt, to the artificial excitement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>of the Louisiana claimant, but was without influence upon
the action of the House.<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c010'><sup>[400]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The General Assembly of Louisiana, as previously related,
had chosen Charles Smith and R. King Cutler as United
States Senators. With the Representatives-elect these gentlemen
also appeared in Washington as claimants for seats.
On December 7, two days after Congress assembled, the
president <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tempore</span></i> presented certain proceedings of the
Louisiana Legislature declaratory of the election of Smith
and Cutler. The papers, it was announced, would lie on the
table unless otherwise ordered. Just as Henry Winter Davis
had done in the House, Senator Wade offered a memorial
from Louisiana citizens remonstrating against their admission,
and also against the reception of any electoral vote from
that State. On his motion it was agreed that all documents
pertaining to the subject be printed. On the following day,
December 8, the credentials as well as the remonstrance were
referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Trumbull on February 17 succeeding made a report
from his committee, and offered a joint resolution relative
to the credentials of Smith and Cutler. At the request of
Charles Sumner the resolution was read at length and was
as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>That the United States do hereby recognize the government of the
State of Louisiana, inaugurated under and by the convention which
assembled on the 6th day of April, A. D., 1864, at the city of New
Orleans, as the legitimate government of the said State, and entitled to
the guarantees and all other rights of a State government under the
Constitution of the United States.<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c010'><sup>[401]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This resolution was limited to Louisiana because the facts,
while in many respects similar, were not identical with those
in the case of Arkansas. Besides, when the subject first came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>up in committee the Arkansas case had not been presented,
though it arose before Louisiana had been disposed of.
Trumbull believed it the intention of the committee to act
immediately upon Arkansas when the case of Louisiana had
been considered.<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c010'><sup>[402]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Sumner moved, February 23, to strike out all of the joint
resolution except the enacting clause, and to substitute the
following:</p>

<p class='c013'>That neither the people nor the Legislature of any State, the people
of which were declared to be in insurrection against the United States
by the proclamation of the President, dated August 16, 1861, shall hereafter
elect Representatives or Senators to the Congress of the United
States until the President, by proclamation, shall have declared that
armed hostility to the Government of the United States within such
State has ceased; nor until the people of such State shall have adopted
a constitution of government not repugnant to the Constitution and
laws of the United States; nor until, by a law of Congress, such State
shall have been declared to be entitled to representation in the Congress
of the United States of America.<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c010'><sup>[403]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>To this amendment Senator Trumbull objected that it
would put it in the power of the President, by refusing to issue
his proclamation, to keep a State out forever. Sumner’s substitute
was promptly defeated by a vote of 29 to 8.<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c010'><sup>[404]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Of the members of the committee Powell alone opposed
the resolution offered by Mr. Trumbull. The chief object in
recognizing the government of Louisiana at that time, said
the Kentucky Senator, was to allow that State to vote for the
proposed amendment of the Constitution; to do that effectually
those favorable to the resolution desired first to admit
her Senators and Representatives; their admission would be
the immediate effect of its passage.</p>

<p class='c000'>A just conclusion on that subject could be reached only
by information concerning the action of the President, of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>military, and of the people of Louisiana in connection with
the election. He opposed the loyal government because it
was not formed by the people of that State; however, he did
not want to be classed with those who thought Louisiana out
of the Union. He believed that something approximating a
majority of her people should indicate a willingness to return
to the Union, and should participate in the movement
for reorganization. The formation of the existing government,
he asserted, was controlled and influenced by persons
who were not citizens of Louisiana, and, he added, “It is
a government formed really and virtually by the military
power of the United States, using as instruments delegates
who were elected under and by force of the bayonet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Before Senators could vote for the resolution, he continued,
they must maintain the doctrine announced in the
President’s proclamation of December 8, 1863, when he proposed
that one tenth of the loyal voters in a State who would
comply with the conditions therein prescribed, could form a
State government; they must further maintain that the President,
of his own volition, had power by decretal order to alter
the constitution of a State; that the President had power to
prescribe the qualifications both of voters and candidates for
office in the States; finally they must believe that not only did
the President possess these powers, but that Major-General
Banks, in virtue of his office, possessed them in Louisiana.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Powell proposed to show that not only did Louisiana
people not act of their own volition, but that “they were coerced
to do what they did.” The constitution of that State,
he asserted, was not made by the free suffrage of the people.</p>

<p class='c000'>The creation of a State government is a purely civil act; the
people must act without restraint. He had never heard any
Senator say that the President could legitimately exercise the
power assumed in his proclamation of December 8, 1863.
Mr. Powell objected to the oath which was to be taken as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>a condition precedent to becoming a qualified elector in one
of the revolted States, especially to that portion which promised
support of all future proclamations of the President on
the question of slavery. “Why, sir,” he exclaimed, “the
President may proclaim that the negro shall be the master
and the white man the slave; that the negro shall be the voter
and the white man deprived of the right of suffrage; and yet
this oath requires the man taking it to swear in advance
that he would support even such a measure as that....</p>

<p class='c000'>“At the very threshold, then,” he continued, “you repudiate
the great principle of republican government that majorities
shall rule. Here you propose to say not that majorities, but
that less than one tenth shall rule.” It was intimated by the
President that when they made a constitution it must not recognize
African slavery. General Banks, carrying out the
suggestion of the President, as well as what had been distinctly
stated to General Steele in relation to Arkansas, took it
upon himself to alter the constitution of Louisiana in that
respect.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whence does the President, it was asked, derive the power
to prescribe qualifications for either electors or candidates?
The proclamation, the Kentucky Senator asserted, was the
basis of the whole proceeding, and those who voted for the
resolution endorsed the proclamation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Powell then reviewed the acts and read the proclamation
of General Banks, whose conduct he denounced for presuming
to declare certain parts of the Louisiana constitution
no longer applicable to any class of persons in that State, and,
therefore, inoperative and void.</p>

<p class='c000'>He further objected that Banks had no authority to call
the convention, for the constitution of Louisiana could be
lawfully amended in only the mode pointed out by itself.
The President’s proclamation, he added, would allow only
those to vote who were qualified electors under the fundamental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>law of the State; those in the army and navy were
not, but General Banks in his ukase of February 13, 1864,
allowed them to participate in the election.</p>

<p class='c000'>He also invited attention to the action of the Department
Commander in designating provost marshals to take care that
the polls were properly opened, in the absence of the sheriffs,
and that suitable persons were appointed judges of election
and so forth. Of the 11,414 votes he asserted that 808 were
cast by soldiers who under the President’s proclamation
were not legal voters. The fact, added Mr. Powell, that
General Banks after the inauguration of Hahn as governor
continued to issue proclamations shows that the civil was controlled
by the military authority.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing on to a discussion of the statement of Banks before
the Committee on the Judiciary that the military did not
interfere in the election of February 22, Senator Powell
quoted the following passages from a proclamation of the
Department Commander:</p>

<p class='c013'>Those who have exercised or are entitled to the rights of citizens of
the United States will be required to participate in the measures necessary
for the reëstablishment of civil government.... It is therefore
a solemn duty resting upon all persons to assist in the earliest
possible restoration of civil government. Let them participate in the
measures suggested for this purpose. Opinion is free and candidates are
numerous. Open hostility cannot be permitted. Indifference will be
treated as a crime, and faction as treason.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Talk to me,” exclaimed Mr. Powell, “of freedom of
election under such military orders! Why, sir, there was
but one free man, in my opinion, in all Louisiana at that time,
and that was Major-General Banks; and I do not know that
he was free, for he was serving his master at the White
House.” The fundamental law there was martial law, which
is but the will of the commander-in-chief, and under that law
he could have beheaded them if they did not vote.</p>

<p class='c000'>From beginning to end, he continued, the coercive finger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>of the military was engaged in the establishment of that
government. Under the various proclamations even Unionists,
men who had always been loyal, could not vote unless
they took the oath required in the President’s proclamation.
There was a large class of loyal men in Louisiana, he said,
who refused to take that oath, for there had been presented
to the Judiciary Committee an earnest protest signed by
Thomas J. Durant and thirty-one others, influential Union
men of that State, against the admission of Senators and
Representatives and against counting its electoral vote.
Those Senators, he added toward the conclusion of his remarks,
who only a few days before opposed the counting of
Louisiana’s electoral vote should now vote against the resolution
acknowledging the government which appointed the
Senators that are claiming seats.<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c010'><sup>[405]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Sumner and Davis referred to the resolution as a shadow.
To this Mr. Doolittle replied that the vote of Louisiana
might be necessary to secure the constitutional amendment,
and that the new constitution of that State had struck the
shackles from 90,000 slaves not reached by the Emancipation
Proclamation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Henderson, who favored the resolution, secured the
floor, and observed, among other things, that Louisiana and
Arkansas did not claim that they were yet strong enough to
maintain their governments without the military aid of the
nation; but neither was Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky
or Missouri; even Ohio, Indiana or Illinois, he said, could
not without national assistance maintain their State organizations
for sixty days against the Confederate armies.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If we would have State governments,” said Mr. Henderson,
“we must begin somewhere and at some time.” It was
nonsensical, he argued to talk of restoring the Union, while
keeping the loyal people in those States for all time to come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>under military domination. “We must declare the right in
Congress,” he added, “to make and establish these governments
for the States, or permit the President, under military
law, to set them up, or we must recognize such as the loyal
people may set up for themselves.” If, as Madison thought,
Congress cannot make them, but can only guarantee such as
already exist and are found to be republican in form, it must
be left with the President, under his power as the head of the
army, or to the people of the respective States. If left entirely
with the President he might by military force impose upon the
State a constitution against the wishes of both the loyal and
disloyal. The Senator frankly admitted that neither House
would be under any obligation to receive members sent from a
State so constituted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” he went on to say, “if the people—the loyal
masses, whether a majority or a minority of the whole voting
population as formerly known—participated in its creation
and acquiesce in the revival of the State government, the case
though inaugurated by the President in my judgment would
be very different. According to the theory of our Government,
and its practice in all its past time in analogous cases,
it would seem that whether Congress or the President inaugurated
the proceeding, the constitution can only receive its
validity and authority from the approval or acquiescence of
the people to be affected; and that brings me to consider
how the people in the seceded States shall revive their governments,
and who are the legally qualified voters for that
purpose in these States.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At the threshold of the inquiry we are met with the objection
that the States are now without officers of any kind
legally elected, and that of themselves they are powerless to
inaugurate any movement to set up a loyal government. It
is said they have no officials to superintend the election, to
count the votes, and grant certificates of election. However
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>desirable these formalities may be, it has not been the uniform
practice of Congress to require them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of California, continued Mr. Henderson, the
first election was called by the military order of a subordinate
officer of the army, a delegate convention was chosen, a constitution
was framed by that assembly and submitted to Congress.
It was accepted as republican in form, and under it a
State government was inaugurated that for fifteen years
had been administered with the greatest success. The territory,
he said, was wholly without civil authorities recognized
by the United States. Congress had passed no enabling
act, had prescribed no forms of proceeding, had failed to
fix the qualifications of voters, had appointed no judges of
election or other officers to count and certify the votes; yet
the act, however informal, was ratified because the constitution
on its face was unobjectionable in form, and it was
believed that the people interested acquiesced in the government
it established.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the people of Rhode Island, added Mr. Henderson, had
acquiesced in the government set up under Dorr, Congress
and the Executive would have recognized it as legitimate.
The Senator from Kentucky contended that although a majority
of the legal and qualified voters of Louisiana should acquiesce
in the new constitution Congress could not admit the
State. In support of his view Mr. Henderson pointed to the
State government of Missouri, which was the offspring of a
movement purely revolutionary.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the States whose representatives were seeking admission
to Congress but one government asked recognition, and what
if these organizations were of revolutionary origin?—the
revolution was on the side of loyalty. Revolutionary governments
had been accepted in time of peace—governments
springing up in the midst of anarchy, without the sanctions
of regularity; why, he asked, should they be rejected now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>when they were needed to protect the loyal inhabitants of
the respective States and to aid the nation in vindicating its
lost authority?</p>

<p class='c000'>The assertion that on the face of these constitutions they
were republican in form Senator Sumner denied. They did
not follow out the principles of the Federal Constitution. This
general answer was unsatisfactory, and Mr. Henderson said
that the only question with him was how could he best get
these States performing their legitimate functions in the Union
again. If, as the Massachusetts Senator maintained, the act
of secession took the States out, why could not the act of loyal
men bring them back? If secession, he argued, was potent
enough to take a State out, and that was mere revolution, why
could not the loyal men perfect a revolution on the side of
Government as well as rebels perfect a revolution on the side
of secession, outrage and wrong?</p>

<p class='c000'>The doctrine that secession took the States out of the
Union, Sumner objected to have imputed to him. A subsequent
remark indicated one ground of his opposition to the
government of Louisiana. “If the loyal men, white and
black, recognize it, then,” he declared, “it will be republican
in form. Unless that is done, it will not be.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When asked whether Congress could interfere with the
right of suffrage in one of the States, Sumner evaded a candid
reply, and concealed his meaning under these words:
“It is the bounden duty of the United States by act of Congress
to guarantee complete freedom to every citizen, and
immunity from all oppression, and absolute equality before
the law.” No government that does not guarantee these
things, he added, can be recognized as republican in form
according to the theory of the Federal Constitution, if the
United States are called upon to enforce the constitutional
guaranty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Henderson, interpreting this answer in the affirmative,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>observed that if under the guaranty clause the national
Legislature could regulate the suffrage in the States, there
was no limitation except the mere discretion of Congress. In
support of this position he cited Madison in No. 43 of <cite>The
Federalist</cite>, and of course had this part of the argument his
own way, for the test of a republican form satisfactory to
the Massachusetts Senator would leave few representatives
in Congress.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Henderson denied that the admission of Senators and
Representatives from these commonwealths would be a precedent
for other States to demand recognition, even with the
institution of slavery, thus bringing back the germs of a new
rebellion against the Government; because in the constitutions
presented involuntary servitude was abolished. With slavery
remaining any restoration would be utterly useless. It was
against union with the free States that the Southern people
had taken up arms, and against restoration that they continued
to use them. In that struggle they would employ every moral
and material force, including the slave himself, stimulated by
the boon of freedom, to resist the return of their States.
Whatever the future might bring, it would fail to bring to the
doors of Congress seeking admission a State constitution
without a positive interdict of slavery.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the objection that a majority of the people of these States
were in rebellion and that to recognize the loyal minority
would be to subvert the whole republican system Senator Henderson
replied that if it were strictly true that a majority in
a particular community “not only shall but must govern,”
then a majority of legal voters in a State desiring to secede
would have the undoubted right to do so. As no principle of
the General Government authorized such action, it was not
true, he said, that a majority of citizens in a State can govern
themselves except in strict obedience to the Constitution of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>the United States. If a majority proved derelict and undertook
to destroy the very Government of which the State is
a part, it is right that the minority, who sustain the Government
in its entirety, State and national, should institute government
for their protection. He admitted that General
Banks did a great many things for which there was no legal
authority; but the question was whether this constitution was
the will of the loyal men of Louisiana. If it was, their representatives
had a right to seats on the floor of Congress.</p>

<p class='c000'>In reply to Sumner, Senator Henderson said he favored
the idea that the loyal men should govern a State, and he
added, if that be the government of the few it results from
the voluntary disloyalty of the many. They, of their own
will, had relinquished the right to govern themselves under
the Constitution, and as they had no right to govern themselves
otherwise they could not govern at all. As to the
oligarchy of skin, to which Sumner had referred, Henderson
believed that the regulation of the suffrage was a question for
the consideration of the States; if they conferred the franchise
on the negro, he did not object.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the Louisiana constitution the question was whether
it embodied the will of those legally entitled to exercise the
functions of the State government. If the casting of illegal
votes vitiated elections, but few elections, he asserted, would
be valid.</p>

<p class='c000'>If those States were admitted, they could immediately
settle all questions of suffrage, and Congress would be relieved
of the difficulty in future. He put clearly the difference
of opinion prevailing among Senators on this subject
when he stated that Mr. Powell objected to the new constitution
of Louisiana because negro soldiers were permitted to
vote, while Mr. Sumner opposed it because negroes at home
did not vote. Concluding this part of his speech, he declared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>that the Federal Government by recognizing the old organization
in Rhode Island against Dorr expressed its preference
for a constitution of restricted suffrage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without naming his authority Henderson then read from
a private letter the opinion of a gentleman whom he regarded
as one of the ablest jurists in the United States.<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c010'><sup>[406]</sup></a> The correspondent
said in part:</p>

<p class='c013'>It must be observed that the civil society, and the political society so
to speak, of a State need not necessarily do [be] the same. In other
words the basis of <em>representation</em> may be the whole population, but the
basis of <em>suffrage</em> be property, adult years, &amp;c. The power to choose
rulers is lodged in the voters, and they may not exceed one tenth of
the population.... That portion of the population in which political
power is lodged, determines who shall fill the respective offices, make
laws, etc. Although the members of that society may have possessed
every requisite therefor, yet the moment they ceased to be citizens of the
United States they ceased to belong thereto.</p>

<p class='c013'>That rule holds good with respect to every member, and the political
society may, by death, disqualification of members, &amp;c., be reduced to a
very few persons. To state an extreme case, for illustration of the principle,
Massachusetts formerly had a property qualification, and although
her population entitled her to, say, thirteen Representatives in the
United States House, her voters may not have exceeded fifty thousand.
Suppose while that qualification remained, by some financial or other
disaster, only one thousand or one hundred citizens retained the necessary
income or property, would not the persons chosen to Congress by
the few and only remaining voters be duly elected? So with regard to
any other element of suffrage, as United States citizenship, if by its
loss the voters are reduced to very few in number, do not those few
constitute the political or voting power? As to the policy or impolicy
of restricted suffrage, we are not now concerned, but are endeavoring to
reach a constitutional and legal analysis of our governmental system.</p>

<p class='c013'>But here is encountered the startling and practical difficulty, “Shall a
few persons be permitted to govern a State, despite the wishes of its
inhabitants, and without giving them all a voice? Is that republican?”</p>

<p class='c013'>But it must be remembered that the few voters, say one seventh, or
one tenth of the whole population, have always been intrusted with that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>power. Wisdom has fixed the basis of suffrage, without regard to relative
numbers; that is, it has endeavored, under our popular system, to
give the right or privilege to as many citizens as were supposed competent
to exercise it intelligently. The rules prescribed as to age, sex, citizenship,
&amp;c., were deemed essential, right, and proper. Whether many or
few come within the rules does not affect their validity.... If
persons heretofore entitled to a vote chose to commit a felony, and incur
thereby, as a penalty, the deprivation of their former right of suffrage,
it is not supposed that the loss of such votes is anti-republican. If, then,
a majority choose to perpetrate treason, or to expatriate themselves, or
in any other way become disqualified, how does that action vitiate the
rule? If they, after becoming disqualified, remain in the State, are they
not bound to submit to its rulers and laws? If their rulers are chosen
without their voice, is it not in consequence of their own voluntary action?
Indeed, it often happens that the persons elected to office receive only a
meager minority of the votes which could have been lawfully polled, yet
that fact has no influence upon the legal result. So a person is often
chosen by a minority of the votes actually cast, and is not the majority
bound to submit?</p>

<p class='c000'>The author of this letter appears to have been more familiar
with the Constitution, as it was understood by its framers,
than almost any member of either House, notwithstanding the
presence in Congress of many distinguished statesmen. In
the following eight propositions Mr. Henderson then gave a
masterly summary of the Presidential plan of reconstruction:</p>

<p class='c013'>1. I hold that the seceded States are still in the Union and cannot get
out of it except through amendment of the Constitution permitting it.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. The seceded States being still in the Union are entitled to claim all
the rights accorded to other States.</p>

<p class='c013'>3. That each State now in the Union has the right to stand upon the
form of its constitution as it existed at the time of its admission. The
people of such State may change its constitution, provided they retain a
republican form of government; but neither the President nor Congress
can reform, alter, or amend such constitution, nor prescribe any
alteration or amendment as a condition of association with the other
States of the Union. The General Government may properly lend its
aid to enable the people to express their will; but any attempt to exercise
power constitutionally reserved to the State, beyond what may be
demanded by the immediate exigencies of war, will not tend to restore
the Union, but rather to destroy our whole system of government.</p>

<p class='c013'>4. When citizens of a State rebel and take up arms against the General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>Government they lose their rights as citizens of the United States, and
they necessarily forfeit those rights and franchises in their respective
States which depend on United States citizenship.</p>

<p class='c013'>5. If a seceded State be still in the Union, entitled to recognition as a
State, and a majority of the people have voluntarily withdrawn their
allegiance, the loyal minority constitute the State and should govern it.</p>

<p class='c013'>6. Congress should not reject the governments presented because of
mere irregularity in the proceedings leading to their reorganization.</p>

<p class='c013'>7. If Congress has no right to make and impose a constitution upon
the people of any State; if its power extends no further than to guaranty
preëxisting republican forms of government; if the State still
exists, and the loyal men are entitled to exercise the functions of its
government, it follows that the only questions to be examined here are,
first, is the constitution the will of the loyal men qualified to act? and,
second, is it republican in form?</p>

<p class='c013'>8. The constitutions of Louisiana and Arkansas are thought to be
republican in form, and it is admitted that the loyal men of those
States respectively acquiesce in them. Hence the duty of Congress to
recognize them, and the duty of each House to admit their representatives.<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c010'><sup>[407]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On February 25 debate on Trumbull’s resolution was resumed.
At this point Mr. Sumner offered an amendment in
substance as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>That it is the duty of the United States at the earliest practicable
moment, consistent with the common defence and general welfare, to
reëstablish by act of Congress republican governments in those States
where loyal governments have been vacated by the existing rebellion,
and thus, to the full extent of their power, fulfil the requirement of the
Constitution, that “the United States shall guaranty to every State in
this Union a republican form of government.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 2. <em>And be it further resolved</em>, That this important duty is imposed
by the Constitution in express terms on “the United States,” and not
on individuals or classes of individuals, or on any military commander
or executive officer, and cannot be intrusted to any such persons, acting,
it may be, for an oligarchical class, and in disregard of large numbers of
loyal people; but it must be performed by the United States, represented
by the President and both Houses of Congress, acting for the whole
people thereof.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 3. <em>And be it further resolved</em>, That, in determining the extent of
this duty, and in the absence of any precise definition of the term
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>“republican form of government,” we cannot err, if, when called to
perform this guaranty under the Constitution, we adopt the self-evident
truths of the Declaration of Independence as an authoritative rule,
and insist that in every reëstablished State the consent of the governed
shall be the only just foundation of government, and all men shall be
equal before the law.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not less important is the declaration in the fourth section
that “in the performance of this guaranty, there can be
no power under the Constitution to disfranchise loyal people,
or to recognize any such disfranchisement, especially
when it may hand over the loyal majority to the government
of the disloyal minority; nor can there be any power under
the Constitution to discriminate in favor of the rebellion
by admitting to the electoral franchise rebels who have forfeited
all rights and by excluding loyal persons who have
never forfeited any right.” To allow the reëstablishment of
any State without proper safeguards for the rights of all the
citizens, and especially without making it impossible for rebels
to trample upon the rights of those who are now fighting
the battles of the Union, would be, said the succeeding section,
for the United States to fail in duty under the Constitution.</p>

<p class='c000'>More directly in opposition to the resolution reported by
the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, however, was the
seventh section, which declared “That a government founded
on military power, or having its origin in military orders,
cannot be a ‘republican form of government’ according to
the requirement of the Constitution; and that its recognition
will be contrary not only to the Constitution, but also to
that essential principle of our Government which, in the
language of Jefferson, establishes ‘the supremacy of the civil
over the military authority.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>The resolutions further asserted that a government
founded on an oligarchical class, even if erroneously recognized
as a “republican form of government,” could not sustain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>itself without national support; that such an organization
was not at that moment competent to discharge the duties and
execute the powers of a State, and that its recognition would
tend to enfeeble the Union, to postpone the day of reconciliation
and to endanger the national tranquillity. The ninth
section renders clear one ground of Sumner’s hostility to the
recognition of Louisiana. It asserts that</p>

<p class='c013'>Considerations of expediency are in harmony with the requirements
of the Constitution, and the dictates of justice and reason, especially
now, when colored soldiers have shown their military value; that as their
muskets are needed for the national defence against rebels in the field,
so are their ballots yet more needed against the subtle enemies of the
Union at home; and that without their support at the ballot-box the
cause of human rights and of the Union itself will be in constant
peril.<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c010'><sup>[408]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It was agreed on motion of Mr. Sumner to have his amendment
printed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Howard, of Michigan, entered at this point into
the debate. Much of what he said has already been related
in the preceding narration of events leading up to the reinauguration
of a loyal government in Louisiana. While admitting
that the President’s plan had been undertaken for
patriotic ends, he could not, he said, recognize in the Executive,
without the subsidiary aid of an act of Congress, any
right to assure a community, composed of voters numbering
one tenth of the electors who participated in the Presidential
contest of 1860, that it would be recognized as a legitimate
government and entitled to the constitutional guaranty. This,
he said, was a stretch of authority beyond any previous attempt,
and he thought it time that Congress, in whom,
he believed, rested solely the authority of readmitting
and reconstructing the rebellious States, “should lay hold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>of this subject, assert their power, and provide by some statute
of uniform application for the reconstruction, as it is called,
and readmission of the insurrectionary States. That is their
right and their duty; that is not the right, it is not the duty of
the President.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A State he defined negatively as not “the geographical
superficies,” the land, on which population resides, and positively
as “a moral person, a political community, possessing
the faculty of political government.” The land, he said, is
the theatre on which the political community moves and acts,
but is endowed with no thought, no right, no duty. The
thinking beings residing upon it constitute the State.<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c010'><sup>[409]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“A State of the Union or a State in the Union is, therefore,
a people yielding obedience to the laws of the Union,
that is, the acts of Congress and the national treaties....
A people who have a State government which is
republican in form; a people who were one of the original
thirteen States which formed the United States, or a people
who have, since the adoption of the Constitution, been, in
the language of that Constitution, ‘admitted by the Congress
into this Union’ as States upon an equal footing with the
original States; for this equality of rights and powers as
States is plainly implied by the language and the manifest
intention of the instrument; and no other people except such
original State or admitted State; none but a State which permits
the laws of the Union to have full scope and force within
its limits; none but a State which sends Senators and Representatives
to Congress friendly to the Government itself, willing
to vote men and money to support and uphold it, who believe
that a person forcibly resisting its authority is a traitor
and deserving of death; none but a State which is willing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>bring to trial, to convict such a traitor, and to punish him for
his treason; none but a State whose population is capable of
furnishing both the grand jury to indict and the traverse jury
to convict such a traitor; none but a State whose population
and whose authorities are in favor not only of permitting the
laws of the United States relating to civil rights to be executed,
but who are willing that the punitive code of the
nation, the code of vengeance against its enemies, shall be
carried out; none but such are States of the Union....</p>

<p class='c000'>“To be in fact a State of the Union and in the Union, this
will or consent of the people must be in harmony with the
Constitution, and its movements subsidiary to it. It must
regard the Constitution as its highest political good; its injunctions
as the highest human law, its commands as the
infallible and final measure of civil duty. In short, to be in
the Union is to be actively and willingly coöperating with
other States in the performance of all those acts and things
without which the Federal Government cannot act or move,
cannot perform the functions required of it by the Constitution;
it is to elect Senators and Representatives to the Congress
of the United States; to permit the courts of the United
States to be held within their limits, and its citizens to act as
jurors and officers of the court; to permit the judgments and
sentences of the court to be executed against its citizens; to
permit the United States mail to be carried through the State
and its contents distributed according to law; to permit the
officers of the United States to collect the Federal revenue
whether derived from foreign or domestic products; to permit
the United States to manage and control their own property,
whether consisting of forts, dockyards, arsenals, mints,
or public lands; to make such elections of Senators and Representatives
freely and as the means of maintaining itself as
a State in the Union; and to permit all these things willingly
and freely as rights belonging to the Federal Government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>with which neither the State government nor the people of
the State have any right whatever to interfere. In short, to
be a State in the Union is to use all those powers of the
State which have a relation to the Federal Government in a
manner friendly to that Government, friendly to its existence
and continuance, in a manner promotive of the objects of that
Government; and to permit without hindrance the exercise
within the State of all the powers of the Federal Government.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Though he declined to discuss the question whether a State
by omitting to send Representatives and Senators to Congress
would on that account cease to be a member of the Union, he
gave it as his opinion that mere failure to be represented in
Congress would not be followed by such consequences; but if
a State not only refused to participate in Federal legislation
but went farther, and as a political community made war
upon the General Government, he declared that “it would be
folly, madness, to say that the State was not our enemy in
every sense in which that term can be employed to describe
hostile relations between independent communities....
No one will pretend that such a community is in the Union
in fact, for that would be to make an admission and in the
same breath to contradict it. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De facto</span></i>, such a community,
and, if it be bounded by State lines, such a State, is as completely
out of the Union as is Canada or Mexico, from the
moment it assumes the attitude of hostility until it is subdued
and conquered by our arms, or until it voluntarily lays down
its arms, ejects its hostile government and returns <em>in fact</em> to
its once friendly sentiments and friendly relations to the
Federal Government.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Loyalty,” continued Senator Howard, “thus becomes the
final test in solving the question, what is a State in the Union?
If a State by its overt acts has shown a want of this friendship,
it is no longer in the Union <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i>, and cannot be treated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>as if it were. The Supreme Court, acting upon the soundest
principles of public law, have decided the waging of war by
a State, although acting under an illegitimate and revolutionary
government, renders her territory enemy’s territory, and
the people there resident enemies of the United States, in the
sense of the laws of war. And their decision could not have
been different.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The State, he argued further, was in fact, though wrongfully,
out of the Union because its actual government was
disloyal and treasonable. Out of it because unsubdued rebellion
made it for the time being an independent though
unrecognized nation on the earth’s surface, throwing off its
allegiance to its paramount Government, and assuming by
the sword to assert its separate nationality.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But we are at war with the rebel States, and are told
... that the Government, so far at least as the rebel
States are concerned, is under some peculiar constitutional
restraint by which its hands are tied; that we are prohibited
from ‘subjugating’ those States; that all we can do, under
the Constitution, is to break up the military array of the
rebels, disperse their armed bands, take away their arms, and
do that very indefinite duty, <em>restore order</em>; that thereupon
our task is ended and the rebel States have a constitutional
right to come back into the Union and participate in the
enactment of Federal laws and the conduct of the Federal
Government. And we are menaced both in Congress and out
with terrible retributions if we conquer or attempt to conquer,
if we subjugate or attempt to subjugate, the rebel States. It
is admitted by these our critics that in an international war
... we should have all the rights and powers of other
independent nations, and might rightfully conquer our adversary,
... that we might make a complete conquest
of his people and his territory....</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, it is lawful to wage such a foreign war, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>the purpose of effectuating such a complete conquest, and
of course lawful to attain it; ... lawful to substitute
the political authority of the United States for that of a
hostile foreign nation;” otherwise, he argued, the war could
not be a successful one; hence in a war with a member of the
Union the United States could substitute for the authority of
such hostile commonwealth its own authority. There was no
difference between the two cases. The former actual hostile
government should be supplanted by the Federal Government.
No other government had a right to give the law.
Had the conquered rebel people that right? No; for that
would be to allow them at once to expel their conquerors by
a popular decree, and to deny the supremacy of the Federal
Government which had subdued them. Had the old State
government, he asked, the once loyal government, the right
to govern the conquered people? No; there was no such
government. It had long since ceased to exist. “In fact,
there is no government there, none at all, which can for a
moment be recognized or permitted by the United States, as
the party now holding the actual mastery of the country;
and like every other case where the possession of a country
has arisen from the use of superior force, the will of the
conqueror is the law—that is, the will of the United States
expressed, in the absence of acts of Congress, by the Commander-in-Chief
of the Army, but by the acts of Congress
after Congress has spoken.</p>

<p class='c000'>“... No one will deny that we have a right to subdue
by arms and to reduce to quietude and submission a rebel
State, that is, the people of a State in insurrection. But how
absurd to make this concession, and at the same time to
deny to us the constitutional power to occupy and hold the
territory and its people in our military grasp—an occupation
just as necessary to the end in view as the firing of cannon,
the charging of cavalry, or any other operation in the field.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>“... The true objects of the war ... are
the suppression of the rebellion, the reëstablishment of the
original Federal authority within the State, and the revival
of the loyalty of the people of the State as the sole foundation
and condition of all its civil rights as a State of the
Union and of the right of its people to be treated as friends
and not as enemies. Although the United States have the
full and complete right which conquest gives, for the purpose
of subjecting these domestic enemies to the exercise of the
powers granted by the Constitution to Congress, and for the
purpose of restoring to the body-politic its vital blood,
loyalty to the Government, yet those purposes, those distinct
ends, are without doubt limits beyond which we cannot go.
We are restrained by the manifest objects for which the
national Government was formed; but restrained by no particular
clause of the Constitution. The instrument contains
no such clause, and the limitation and restraint are of precisely
the same nature as those which any other government
is under in subduing an insurrection of its own subjects or
citizens; the plain object of the war in both cases being the
restoration of legitimate authority and the revival of allegiance.
And until this revival of allegiance there must be
the same need of military occupation and repression in both
cases.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After showing that the existence of the States is indispensable
to that of the Federal Government, he proceeded, “it
is not permissible by mere interpretation to clothe that Government
with a power permanently to abolish the State government
by way of punishing or suppressing the rebellion;
or to convert the States into mere Territories of the United
States, that is, public domain, to be divided up afterward by
lines different from those of the States, and again admitted
into the Union like matured Territories, with such new
geographical limits as Congress may see fit to establish.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>Article IV., Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution the Senator
regarded as an express prohibition to change the boundaries
of any State once in the Union without its consent;
“its consent in its capacity as a State, freely given by its own
Legislature.” He believed that the Amnesty Proclamation of
President Lincoln indicated that its author held a different
opinion.</p>

<p class='c000'>He rejected the idea that the rebellious States could be converted
into Territories. This term, under our system, he
added, “implies land never lying in any State, land ceded to
the United States either by the old States, or purchased or
conquered from foreign nations. The term never has been
used to describe a State or any part of a State; and it implies
not only the ownership of the soil and right of disposition,
but full and complete political jurisdiction in the Federal Government
over the people resident there....”</p>

<p class='c000'>The objects of the conquest being as stated above, such
forcible occupation was, he continued, in its very nature temporary
and ought to cease the moment those objects were attained.
This could not be done without establishing a government
to preserve order, life and property—a provisional
government, for that is the true historic name to be applied
in all cases where an old government has been overthrown;
a provisional government instituted by the conqueror, and to
be continued just so long as Congress deemed it necessary to
continue it for the attainment, and while attaining, those
high objects. The occupancy, that is, the possession of all
the reins of local government by the Federal authorities
would be but temporary, provisional, fiduciary. It should necessarily
last until the Federal Government had done its duty in
the reëstablishment of order and the revival of loyalty. Until
then it was, and should continue, the omnipotent sovereign of
the State, holding actually by right of conquest, though for a
particular purpose, and being itself necessarily the final judge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>to determine when its tutelary mission had been accomplished.</p>

<p class='c000'>He avoided, he said, a discussion of the question whether a
State can commit suicide, that is, extinguish its own being by
waging a rebellious war against the Federal Government;
instead of presenting any such abstract question of political
dialectics, the case, he declared, merely presented the usual
question which arose whenever and wherever there had been
a forcible revolution. What, he inquired, was the duty of the
paramount and lawful government in its treatment of insurgent
communities? And was not the Government doing its
whole duty in punishing the ringleaders in the revolt and
restoring the old and constitutional Government over those
districts?</p>

<p class='c000'>The Government, Mr. Howard proceeded, must be the final
judge of the duration of this military occupation. It was
bound by the plain terms of the Constitution not only to suppress
the insurrection, which was done the moment it had obtained
firm possession of the whole of the hostile territory, but
to guarantee to the conquered State a republican form of government.
To perform this high and sacred trust, time of
course was necessary; likewise a great variety of means and
instrumentalities, “of all which the Government of the United
States must, because it has no superior, no equal in the
matter, be the sole and final judge. These means may embrace
acts of provisional legislation, creating private rights
and duties not previously in existence, but existing by law
and of a permanent nature, paramount to all subsequent State
legislation because arising under the supreme authority of the
nation, as, for instance, the giving freedom to slaves; or they
may undoubtedly embrace conditions to be performed by the
subdued States on taking their places again in the Union,
such as would be an ordinance forever abolishing slavery
in the State....</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>“Yet while thus in our military power, awaiting our action,
looking to their restoration, nothing is clearer than that the
citizens of the rebel States, though owing obedience to all
the laws of the United States, possess no political rights under
the Constitution except protection. They are not free to act,
because their freedom to act would, if indulged, lead them
again to draw the sword against the United States....
They have no right to send members to this body or to the
House of Representatives, much less to participate in the
election of President and Vice-President. They are the ward-provinces
of the United States, progressing toward the
maturity of revived loyalty, but not yet entitled to exercise the
elective franchise or to participate in the enactment of laws.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I am asked what I mean by the Government of the
United States, and whether I mean that the President as
Commander-in-Chief has the exclusive power to establish
these provisional governments, I answer, I do not. He has
the right to regulate military occupation until Congress has
acted upon the subject; ... but the establishment of
provisional governments, the quieting of the rebellious province
and the reëstablishment of legitimate authority over it,
pertains to the sovereign power, that is, the law-giving power
of the nation. With us that power is lodged in Congress and
not in the President; and in my opinion it is the business of
Congress, and Congress alone, to establish and uphold these
provisional governments.... We need not doubt that
whatever we see fit to enact will be approved and carried out
by the President. We cannot be more truly anxious than he
to fix upon a stable, firm policy for restoring peace and union;
but we ought not to shut our eyes to the necessities he will continually
be under, to the almost irresistible importunities he
will encounter, to provide some sort of civil government for
the subdued States or districts; or to the consequences of leaving
such mighty questions for him to decide. It is our plain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>duty to establish a uniform rule on the subject, so that all
may be treated alike and the same remedy be applied with a
paternal but firm and resolute hand to each delinquent State.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He opposed for two reasons the “scheme” of allowing
one tenth or any other minor part of the male citizens of
a commonwealth to organize a government and assume to
act as a State: first, “because as against the will of an
actual majority the government of such a minority must necessarily
come to a speedy end and thus invite a renewal of the
civil war, in that locality at least; and second, because government
by a minority is of evil example and inconsistent
with the genius of American liberty.... As a Republican
I would sooner hazard ten slaveholders’ rebellions than
risk liberty in a government by a minority.” In this connection
he assigned an additional motive for his attitude toward
the resolution. The will of the friendly element, he said, could
prevail only by military support, and such an organization,
if intended as a civil government, was not republican in the
sense of the Constitution. When such aid was withdrawn the
majority, he asserted, would wreak vengeance on the
weakened minority.</p>

<p class='c000'>Concluding this part of his argument, he added: “The
measure now before you proposes to acknowledge eight thousand
citizens of Louisiana as a State, and to give them the
rights and privileges exercised by a voting population of more
than fifty thousand in 1860. Eight thousand are thus to
give the law or assume to give it to forty-two thousand—to
more than five times their number. This they may do so
long as their decrees are sustained by the presence and consent
of a competent military force; but we all know, both
parties there know, the world knows, and, sir, posterity will
know, that it is not the eight thousand who govern the State,
but the fear of the bayonet, and the fear is inspired solely by
the President of the United States, as Commander-in-Chief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>of the Army and Navy! Disguise it, or attempt to disguise
it, as we may, to this complexion doth it come at last. Yes,
sir, both the eight thousand and the forty-two thousand voters
are governed not by themselves, but by the bayonet! And this
is at present the only government in Louisiana. The object
of the present measure is to continue this hybrid, unnatural
government there. It allows the meager and almost contemptible
proportion of less than one sixth of the voting
population to govern the whole State, and to have the influence
of the whole State in our legislation here, while we
know that if the military forces were withdrawn that privileged
one sixth part would be swept away like chaff before
the hurricane breath of the enraged majority. Sir, such a
government is the merest bubble, especially if unsustained by
military power. This is too obvious to need further comment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All this we might possibly endure,” continued Senator
Howard, “were it not that the measure before us clothes
this mockery of a government, this king of shreds and patches,
this mistletoe State <em>régime</em> that falls to the earth the moment
it ceases to cling around the flag-staff of the national forces,
with the high attribute of voting upon and determining questions
of legislation, questions of war or peace, questions of
prosecuting or ceasing to prosecute the present war, in this
Hall and in the Hall of the House of Representatives. This
measure introduces here Senators and Representatives whose
immediate friends and relatives at home have deliberately
aided and assisted to put to death myriads of Union soldiers
from the North, and in swelling up that vast debt of more
than two thousand million dollars which now rests upon the
country. Think you that such Senators and Representatives,
whose constituents have already been stripped of their property
by the rebel government, and brought down to the depths
of poverty; a community without the habits of labor among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>the intelligent classes; naked, hungry, despondent and sullen;
think you that their Representatives would at the present time
be safe depositories of the power to tax their constituents to
pay this debt? Is it not, on the other hand, the part of prudence
to guard against the contingency of having that debt repudiated
by such legislators and the still more disgraceful
contingency of being, by their votes, aided by a Northern
party, finally compelled to pay the rebel debt of $4,000,000,000?
And tell me, what right has Louisiana, the majority
of whose population is to-day, wherever they are, hostile to
this Government and anxious for its overthrow; what right
has she, upon any recognized principle of public law or justice,
to be represented in Congress?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The treatment accorded Louisiana would, he feared, be a
precedent for the ten remaining States. There would be the
expense of holding each for a time in military occupation to
bolster up their State governments. He preferred for Louisiana
and the other insurgent States a provisional establishment
for regulating domestic affairs, but without representation in
Congress until the mass of their people plainly perceived their
error in attempting to overthrow the General Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>Congress should, he thought, take the subject of readmission
into their own hands. It was for them and not for the
President to execute the important guaranty to each State
of a republican form of government, and that duty became
more and more urgent as the Federal armies swept on from
victory to victory. In making good that guaranty the great
indispensable necessity, he declared, was loyalty.<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c010'><sup>[410]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Howard was followed immediately by Reverdy Johnson,
of Maryland, who to the great surprise of his fellow-Democrats
argued in favor of the resolution. His remarks
were introduced by a concise statement of the chief political
events occurring in Louisiana between the capture of New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>Orleans and the ratification, in September, 1864, of the new
constitution. Concluding this part of his speech he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“These, sir, are the facts. The Committee on the Judiciary—and
in the conclusion to which they came I concurred—were
of opinion that under the circumstances in which the
State was at the period when these proceedings were had, she
could not be recognized as a State of the United States under
that constitution adopted in 1864, except by an act of Congress.
The committee were of opinion that it was not in the
power of the Executive under the circumstances to bring the
State back under that constitution. They were of opinion,
however, that it was competent for Congress to do so, and
the only question before the Committee was, whether, under
the circumstances under which the State was at the time, it
was not the duty of Congress to bring the State back so as
to have her represented in the Union.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His objection to the conclusion of the committee was that
the proceedings which led to the adoption of the constitution
were instituted at the instance and under the power of the
Federal military authorities. The precedent, he admitted,
was really a bad one, and the proposition upon which the
committee were called to decide was whether, if they were
satisfied that the number of votes said to have been cast were
in fact cast, and the persons voting were loyal citizens, they
should be denied the privilege of being represented in the
councils of the nation and subjected to a continuance of military
power. Mr. Johnson added: “My impression is that,
no matter how the proceedings were instituted, whether it was
by the military authority, or by the coming together of the
people of the State, if in point of fact the people of the State
did act voluntarily and were competent to act under the original
constitution, and were authorized to act by being loyal at
the time they did act, it is the duty of the government of the
United States to receive them back.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>“Another objection was that, however true it might be that
it would be in the power of all the voters of the State to adopt
a constitution for themselves, or to claim the right of coming
back to the Union under the constitution existing at the time
of the rebellion, it was not true that it was in the power of
fourteen [eleven] thousand, four hundred and fourteen
voters, when the entire voting population of the State was
fifty-one thousand, to take that course. As it seemed to me
then, and seems now, there is no evidence to show that a
single citizen of Louisiana was excluded from the right of
voting.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not so certain, he argued further, that the eleven
thousand voters who participated were not a large majority
of the actual electors in Louisiana, for the war engaged the
greater part of the voting population, and nine tenths of those
who entered the Confederate service had forfeited their lives
upon the battlefield; of those above or below the military
age many had gone elsewhere, or if they remained in the
State it was as disloyal citizens.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not pretended, he said, in discussing the relation of
the loyal minority to the General Government, that by the act
of secession they ceased to be citizens of the United States.
Their fidelity to the Union entitled them to Federal protection.
If loyal, they had forfeited no rights belonging to them
before the commencement of the rebellion. No Federal law
had been violated, no constitutional obligation evaded by
them. They could not ask admission into the Union, because
to speak such a desire was to subject themselves to
punishment; when the protection of the United States was
afforded them and they could once more declare their sentiments
without hazard they met at their several election polls,
organized their government under existing law, and then,
wishing to change it, met in convention and adopted the
constitution which had been submitted to the Senate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>“Why,” inquired Mr. Johnson, “should we not receive it?”
The right of eleven thousand citizens to change their constitution
was not denied, but their action was questioned because
there were others, then in arms against the Government
of the United States, who did not join them in asserting it.
In examining the question who were to exercise the authority
of the State, he argued: “Now, if it be true that the secession
ordinance had no operation to carry the State out, and that I
understand even the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Sumner]
admitted last night; if it be true that the State is in the
Union notwithstanding the ordinance, then the only question
to be considered is, who are the people of Louisiana that are
to exercise the sovereign authority belonging to the State of
Louisiana? Are they the loyal or the disloyal? There can
be but one answer to that inquiry. It must only be the loyal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Senator Howard admitted, continued Mr. Johnson, that it
is not in the power of the United States to change the territorial
limits of the States that had gone out, because the
Constitution prohibits it. If he had thought for a moment he
would have seen that the Constitution equally prohibits any
interference on the part of the General Government with the
exercise of the right of suffrage in a State. He then combated
at some length the intimation of Senators Howard and Sumner
that any power without a State had a right to prescribe
qualifications for the exercise of the suffrage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Powell, too, concurred in this view and asked by what
authority General Banks and the President undertook to prescribe
the qualifications of voters in Louisiana. The Maryland
Senator replied that this question had been anticipated.
The eleven thousand four hundred and fourteen
voters, according to the proof before the Senate, were all loyal
men and entitled to vote by the original constitution of
Louisiana, no matter how they were brought together. If,
coming together, they did an act which they would have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>authorized to do if they had come together voluntarily they
ought to be received.</p>

<p class='c000'>Powell then inquired, what right had the Senate to presume
that there may not have been twelve thousand loyal voters
in Louisiana who were deprived of the right of suffrage because
of this order of General Banks? As the Kentucky Senator
understood it, no man could vote “unless he would go
forward and take the oath prescribed by the President and
swear to support and sustain all proclamations in regard to
African slavery already issued and all that might afterward
be issued.” Mr. Johnson acknowledged this difficulty and
admitted that he had always felt it; but they had the same
difficulty, he asserted, in his own State, and a much greater
one; he would be sorry to think Maryland was not in the
Union. “Maryland is in the Union,” said Senator Powell.
“The constitution,” observed Johnson in reply, “which now
makes her a State in the Union was adopted the other day.
I mean the one which governs her. She has manumitted her
slaves by force of that constitution. No man in Maryland
seriously contests the obligation of that constitution in that
particular or in any other. But it was adopted, in fact, by
the exclusion of a good many men who were entitled to
vote.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Johnson at this point became engaged in an argument,
not wholly relevant, with Sumner in which he gained some
advantage over the Massachusetts Senator. As a specimen of
the latter’s parliamentary tactics at this time it may not be
irrelevant to reproduce a passage from the <cite>Congressional
Globe</cite>.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Mr. Sumner.</span> Allow me to ask the Senator [Johnson] whether, in his
opinion, the Ordinance governing the Northwest Territory, prohibiting
slavery everywhere throughout that Territory, and which was declared
to be a perpetual compact, could be set aside by any one of the States in
the Territory now.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span><span class='sc'>Mr. Johnson.</span> I certainly think they can, except so far as rights are
vested.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator, then, thinks Ohio can enslave a fellow-man?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Mr. Johnson.</span> Just as much as Massachusetts can.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Mr. Sumner.</span> Massachusetts cannot.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Mr. Johnson.</span> Why not?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Mr. Sumner.</span> Massachusetts cannot do an act of injustice.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Mr. Johnson.</span> Oh, indeed! I did not know that. [Laughter.]<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c010'><sup>[411]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding this claim for his native State Sumner
admitted a moment later that Massachusetts had united in the
Convention of 1787 with South Carolina to deny to Congress
authority to prohibit the slave trade for twenty years, and
he confessed that such action was unjust. His inconsistency
was still further exposed by Senator Henderson, who called
attention to the fact that the educational qualification imposed
by the Massachusetts constitution would exclude from the
franchise almost every negro in Louisiana if the provisions
were applicable in the latter State.<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c010'><sup>[412]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>After this colloquy, not uninteresting to the student of
constitutional history, the Maryland Senator resumed his
remarks:</p>

<p class='c000'>“One word more, sir, and I have done. If Congress passes
this resolution, and the State is admitted, no court will hereafter
be able to decide that she is not a State in the Union,
and no court therefore can call in question the validity or
effect of any provision to be found in her constitution. One
of the provisions of this constitution is that all the slaves of
Louisiana are emancipated. Pass this resolution, admit the
State, and that provision is effectual at once.”<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c010'><sup>[413]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sumner, having in mind the fundamental condition
imposed by Congress upon the admission of Missouri, offered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>the following amendment of the resolution from the Committee
on the Judiciary:</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Provided</em>, That this shall not take effect except upon the fundamental
condition that within the State there shall be no denial of the electoral
franchise, or of any other rights on account of color or race, but all persons
shall be equal before the law. And the Legislature of the State,
by a solemn public act, shall declare the assent of the State to this
fundamental condition, and shall transmit to the President of the United
States an authentic copy of such assent whenever the same shall be
adopted, upon the receipt whereof he shall, by proclamation, announce the
fact; whereupon, without any further proceedings on the part of Congress,
this joint resolution shall take effect.<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c010'><sup>[414]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Though Senator Clark favored the principle of Sumner’s
amendment, he opposed it, as it stood, because it affected a
resolution which proposed “to recognize the government in
the State of Louisiana,” which in his judgment was still a
State in the Union, “having its constitution overthrown, but
desiring and attempting to establish a new” one; and he
added, “I hold that we have no power to amend that constitution;
and that is the reason why I shall be obliged to
vote against it here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He spoke for the adoption of Trumbull’s resolution and,
in doing so, traveled some of the ground gone over by Henderson.
The government of Louisiana, Mr. Clark believed,
belonged to the Union people. He was not aware that any
definite number of persons was required to constitute a State,
nor did he understand how the majority by going into rebellion
could take away the rights of the loyal minority.</p>

<p class='c000'>The guaranty of a republican form of government was
made, he asserted, to meet precisely such a case as had arisen
in Louisiana. In this view it became the duty of Congress to
protect the government established by the minority.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c010'><sup>[415]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Pomeroy, speaking to the principle of Sumner’s amendment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>declared that he would vote against all measures that
looked like Congressional interference with the right to vote
in the States. Saulsbury interrupted him to inquire what he
would have done had the President, or his Secretary of War,
sent armed soldiers to the polls and imposed a test upon
voters as was done in Delaware, where Democrats were chased
into swamps and compelled in the night time to lie out in
the snow. Pomeroy’s only reply to this was to relate his
own experience under Democratic supremacy in the early days
of Kansas. He resumed his remarks on Louisiana, but these
had been anticipated by the speakers who preceded him.
In conclusion he asserted that there were two reasons for
recognizing Arkansas where there was but one in favor of
Louisiana.<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c010'><sup>[416]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Delaware Senator did not fail to call attention to Pomeroy’s
evasion, and said he was glad to observe a change in the
spirit of some of his Republican friends. “I think,” he said,
“they begin to scent the danger in the distance; that they
begin to see that if a Government of law is to be destroyed,
and power is to be concentrated in Executive hands, or in the
hands of Executive agents, there is an end of liberty in this
country. I hail the dawn, therefore, of a better day.”<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c010'><sup>[417]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Henderson again entered into the discussion, and in the
course of his remarks drew from Senator Sumner this remarkable
statement concerning Louisiana: “It is in and it is not.
[Laughter.] The territory is in; but as yet there is no State
government that is in.” In this discussion Sumner asserted
also that when the bill of his friend Senator Wade was before
Congress no one questioned its constitutionality though
it proposed to interfere in the suffrage and to impose a condition
upon States at the time of their reconstruction. Pomeroy
dissented from the doctrine that Congress could reconstruct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>the insurgent States, and maintained that the only question
then was whether they would recognize what the people of
Louisiana had done.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reverdy Johnson pointed out to Sumner the great increase
of representation in Congress which the South would acquire
by an extension of the suffrage to negroes. The three fifths
provision, he said, would be done away with, and he made
the further observation that for years to come the entire colored
vote of that section would be in the hands of a few
white men. He urged recognition of both Louisiana and
Arkansas, so that the constitutional amendment would become
binding, for unless ratified by three fourths of all the
States it would be open to doubt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The session was drawing rapidly toward its close; it was
late in the evening of February 25, and the resolution under
discussion was too important to be passed without due consideration.
These circumstances offered Mr. Wade, who
vehemently opposed the measure, a decent pretext for demanding
the “yeas” and “nays” on his motion to postpone
the subject till the first Monday of December following, 1865.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before a vote was reached on this motion, however, Powell
spoke again at considerable length. In addition to his former
arguments, many of which were repeated, he said that “all
the loyal Union men in the State of Louisiana who refused,
like supple menials and slaves, to crouch beneath the iron
military power of General Banks, and take that oath were
excluded from voting,” and he added, “I believe to-day there
are more men of that description in Louisiana than voted to
ratify this constitution.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When asked by Mr. Henderson whether he had heard of
any objection to it on the part of the loyal men of Louisiana,
Powell answered that Thomas J. Durant and thirty-one others,
distinguished, leading, loyal men of that State, had made
earnest and powerful protest against it, and remonstrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>against the admission to Congress of Senators and Representatives
from Louisiana. They were also opposed to counting
her electoral vote. Mr. Durant, he believed, was the first
district-attorney appointed in Louisiana by the present Executive.
Henderson insinuated by an inquiry that Durant
was himself a candidate for office at that election and took the
oath prescribed. Powell not being informed on these points,
the matter was left in doubt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Kentucky Senator took this opportunity to characterize
the manner of General Banks in his statement before the
Judiciary Committee as that of a “swift witness, to make a
case that he thought would cause Louisiana to be admitted.”
He also called upon some advocate of the resolution to explain
a support of the present measure after voting a few days
before for the resolution declaring that the electoral vote of
Louisiana should not be counted. If Louisiana was then a
legitimate government, why, he asked, was she not entitled
to cast her electoral vote? He did not then believe it a
legitimate government and so opposed the counting of her
electoral vote; but the Senator from Maryland [Mr. Johnson]
and the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Henderson], who then
voted with him, now supported the resolution.<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c010'><sup>[418]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Wade’s motion to postpone further consideration of the
joint resolution till the first Monday of December was defeated
by a vote of 17 to 12.<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c010'><sup>[419]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the course of the discussions to postpone Sumner said
that he would regard its passage as a national calamity. It
would be the political Bull Run of that Administration, sacrificing,
as it would, a great cause and the great destinies of
this Republic. When Trumbull taxed him with intent to
postpone discussion by dilatory motions the Massachusetts
Senator admitted his opposition and declared that to defeat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>the measure he would employ any weapon in the arsenal of
parliamentary warfare.</p>

<p class='c000'>The friends of the Administration endeavored to press their
adversaries to take final action on the resolution. The earnestness
of the two factions provoked rather sharp censure of
Sumner and the few Republicans who acted with him
and were attempting by dilatory motions to fatigue the Senate
into a postponement. Doolittle was especially severe on them,
and particularly on Sumner, who replied with much asperity.
He was supported by Howard and Chandler, while Trumbull,
Foster and Doolittle undertook a defence of the resolution
and its advocates. This wrangling appears to have delighted
the Democratic members. Mr. Hendricks, indeed, made no
attempt to conceal his satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The discordant elements of the Republican party are
exhibiting themselves here,” said the Indiana Senator, “and
I venture the prophecy that a like exhibition will be witnessed
over the country within a very few years. But four years
ago, at the Chicago Convention, when Mr. Lincoln was
nominated for the Presidency a solemn pledge was made to
the people of this country that that party, when it came into
power, would not undertake to interfere with the institutions
of the States. As soon as the disturbed condition of the
country gave the pretext for it, the undertaking was commenced;
and now, when, in the judgment of some, it has been
accomplished, there comes up the grave question, what is to
be done, and what is to be the political condition of the four
million negroes when they are set free? And upon that question
the real strife of to-night has been witnessed. That is
the subject and it need not be disguised. It is growing out
of the discordant elements of the party that now governs the
country.”<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c010'><sup>[420]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Trumbull, in reply to an inquiry of Senator Wade, said that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>he had voted against receiving the electoral vote of Louisiana
because it had not been recognized. Now he proposed to put
it in a condition where it could cast electoral votes, and do all
other acts belonging to a State.</p>

<p class='c000'>To this Wade replied that “If the President of the United
States, operating through his major-generals, can initiate a
State government, and can bring it here and force us, compel
us, to receive as associates on this floor these mere mockeries,
these men of straw who represent nobody, your Republic is
at an end.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sir, I have heard a great deal about this pretended election
in Louisiana that did not come from Major-General
Banks, and I pronounce the proceeding a mockery. It is not
pretended that there could be drummed up from the riffraff
of New Orleans and sent into the vicinity under the mandate
of a Major-General more than about six thousand votes, where
over fifty thousand were formerly polled.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'>“Talk not to me of your ten per cent. principle. A more
absurd, monarchical, and anti-American principle was never
announced on God’s earth——“<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c010'><sup>[421]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>At this point Senator Sherman, of Ohio, interposed to
obtain consideration for a revenue measure which he had in
charge, whereupon his colleague changed somewhat the declamation
against the resolution to a denunciation of its advocates,
especially Trumbull, upon whom he retorted the charge
of retarding legitimate business. Howard resented the charge
of radical factiousness and denounced Trumbull with considerable
warmth. Sherman suggested that enough had been
said on both sides, and in the lighter skirmishing of the
breathing-spell which followed, Mr. Sprague, of Rhode Island,
hitherto a silent spectator of these exciting scenes, declared
that he held in his possession a paper indicating the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>names of the members of the Louisiana Legislature, and it
showed that twenty-five, or twenty-seven or thirty of those
gentlemen who constituted that assembly were officeholders
of the Federal Government, or the government of the State,
which, he said, was the same thing.<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c010'><sup>[422]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>While Sherman’s measure and Trumbull’s resolution were
competing for priority of consideration Sumner remarked
that during the preceding summer, 1864, he had met a distinguished
gentleman just returned from Louisiana; he had
been present at some of the sittings of the convention, having
been in New Orleans in discharge of important public duties.
This gentleman, added Sumner, said compendiously that the
convention was “nothing but a stupendous hoax.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When Reverdy Johnson inquired the name of Sumner’s
informant, Senator Grimes replied that he could furnish a
large number of names of persons present in New Orleans
when the convention was held, and added: “If the Senate will
give a committee I will undertake to prove and I will prove
that the voters whose votes were polled in the outlying parishes
at Thibodeaux and Placquemines, and other places, were carried
in army transports to those places where they polled the
votes, being discharged soldiers and persons belonging in
New Orleans, and were brought back to New Orleans, and
were not residents of the places where they purported to
vote.”<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c010'><sup>[423]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Sumner, immediately after the uncontroverted statement
of Mr. Grimes, added, with more energy than elegance:
“The pretended State government in Louisiana is utterly indefensible
whether you look at its origin or its character. To
describe it, I must use plain language. It is a mere seven-months’
abortion, begotten by the bayonet in criminal conjunction
with the spirit of caste, and born before its time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>rickety, unformed, unfinished—whose continued existence
will be a burden, a reproach, and a wrong. That is the whole
case; and yet the Senator from Illinois now presses it upon
the Senate at this moment to the exclusion of the important
public business of the country.”<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c010'><sup>[424]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The urgency of the army and navy appropriation bills prevented
for the time further consideration of the Louisiana
question. The subject, however, was again brought before
the Senate on March 2, 1865, by Mr. Doolittle, who had received
and had been requested to file with the secretary of the
Senate a certificate, under seal of the State of Louisiana, of the
election of Michael Hahn as a Senator of the United States
from the State of Louisiana for six years from March 4, 1865.
Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, opposed its reception. Doolittle’s
motion to have it laid on the table and filed was, however,
agreed to.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only two days of the session remained; in the temper of
the Senate it was impossible that the resolution could pass at
that time, and the House had not yet taken it up for discussion.
In these circumstances the measure was abandoned,
though very reluctantly, by its champions.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>XI<br /> <span class='large'>INCIDENTS OF RECONSTRUCTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The Emancipation Proclamation did not affect, as is
well known, the status of slaves in the loyal border
States or in the excepted parts of Virginia and Louisiana.
The State of Tennessee, too, as we have seen, was not
named in the edict of freedom; that was published by the President
simply as a measure of military necessity, and was not
regarded by him or by others as operative to prevent, when
war had ceased, a revival of servitude in the insurgent States,
for negroes could easily be imported from those loyal commonwealths
still tolerating that institution. It was uncertain,
too, how the proclamation would affect the status of slaves in
those districts not yet overrun by the Union armies. In the
border States, in Tennessee and in the excepted parts of
Louisiana and Virginia there were probably 2,000,000 men in
bondage. In order, then, to abolish universally as well as
permanently to prohibit involuntary servitude an amendment
of the Constitution was proposed in the familiar language of
the sixth section of the ordinance of 1787. Though it passed
the Senate, April 8, 1864, it failed at that time to receive in
the House the requisite two thirds vote. It has been seen
how upon the recommendation of Mr. Lincoln it was reconsidered
and passed by the Representatives at a succeeding session,
January 31, 1865, and submitted to the States for their
action. It was adopted by his own State, Illinois, on the following
day. By the close of February sixteen others had followed
its example, and before the President’s death twenty in
all had ratified the Amendment. To Mr. Lincoln, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>long held anti-slavery opinions, this expression of public sentiment
was extremely grateful; indeed, less than two months
before his assassination he declared his satisfaction at the
popular verdict, and his confidence that the States would
consummate what Congress had so nobly begun. The Thirteenth
Amendment, however, was not announced as part of
the organic law until after the Presidential plan of reconstruction
had been ignored by the Thirty-ninth Congress. This
subject, therefore, need not be further discussed in these
pages.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extraordinary amount of work actually completed by
the national Legislature can be comprehended only by considering
the degree of perfection to which the committee system
has been carried under congressional government. Measures
that conduct the reader over vast stretches of the records
of Congress occupy but a day or two in the calendar.
The discussions described in the two preceding chapters did
not, as might be supposed, engage the entire attention of Federal
legislators. It was desirable, if, indeed, it was not essential,
that the sentiments of the lawmaking body of the nation
be authoritatively declared on the question of admitting members
to Congress from those States reconstituted under the
Executive plan; definitive action in the matter of the electoral
votes which they presented was also awaited with not a little
interest. Scarcely inferior in importance and more instructive
than these measures was the passage of an act, approved
March 3, 1865, which created in the War Department a “Bureau
of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands.” As
the system of relief then inaugurated was destined to become
an important agency in the work of reconstruction a brief
account of its origin and institution may not be deemed superfluous.</p>

<p class='c000'>A former chapter has related how great numbers of “contrabands,”
by assembling early in the war at Fortress Monroe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>and Newport News, taxed the ingenuity of even General Butler
to provide for their maintenance; it also noticed an attempt
under Mr. E. L. Pierce to improve the condition of abandoned
slaves in South Carolina, and the friendly interest of
Secretary Chase in that experiment. But the hundreds of
fugitives within Federal lines in May, 1861, had grown to
be millions by the beginning of 1865. Of this army of homeless
freedmen the policy of enlisting colored troops provided
directly for nearly 200,000 able-bodied males. The
women, the children and the large class unsuitable for military
service left a multitude still unprovided for. Some
relief, it is true, was afforded by the Treasury Department,
which undertook to establish on abandoned and confiscated
lands colonies of self-supporting negroes, but the ignorance
and rapacity of many persons entrusted with the supervision
of this work led to its general failure. Here and there, indeed,
more satisfactory results were obtained, though these
isolated successes seldom reached the point of actual encouragement.
The South Carolina experiment may, therefore,
be properly regarded as the germ of the Freedmen’s Bureau.</p>

<p class='c000'>The progress of these communities had been watched anxiously
by the abolition and the kindred associations which
sprang up to continue the work that anti-slavery men had
begun. On this subject a committee representing the Freedmen’s
Aid Societies of Boston, New York, Philadelphia and
Cincinnati addressed, December 1, 1863, an able memorial to
the President. Without expressing a favorable opinion of
the plan suggested by the petitioners, Mr. Lincoln referred
the question, as one of great magnitude and importance, to
the consideration of Congress. The Freedmen’s Aid Societies,
however, had been anticipated by Representative Eliot,
of Massachusetts, who had offered, January 12, 1863, a bill
to establish a Bureau of Emancipation, which was referred to
a select committee; but other business, regarded as more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>urgent, prevented them from reporting at that time a measure
which had been prepared. At the succeeding session the
proposition was offered again. After numerous efforts to
secure favorable action, efforts extending over a period of
two years, Congress took the subject into consideration.
The House proposed one, the Senate a different measure; a
committee of conference suggested something unlike either,
though embodying important features of both. This, like
every proposition affecting the negro, encountered considerable
opposition. The creation of such a bureau, said its adversaries,
conceded the very point that pro-slavery men had
always maintained; namely, that the negro was incapable of
taking care of himself. The extent of its powers, its duration
and the cost of its maintenance were successively made
grounds of opposition by those hostile to its establishment.
Nor did its enemies fail to point out the great temptation to
abuse which was offered by the system.</p>

<p class='c000'>The act established in the War Department, to continue
during the rebellion and for one year thereafter, a bureau
to which should be committed the management of all confiscated
or abandoned lands, and the control of all subjects
relating to refugees and freedmen from any district within
the territory embraced in the operations of the army, under
such regulations as might be adopted by the head of the
bureau and approved by the President.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conduct of the bureau was entrusted to a commissioner
appointed by the President with the concurrence of the
Senate. In the exercise of his functions he was to be assisted
by such clerks as the Secretary of War might assign him;
their number, of course, was limited by law. For his compensation
the head of the new bureau was to receive a sum
fixed at $3,000 per annum. To aid in executing the provisions
of the act the President was authorized to select, by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate, one assistant commissioner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>for each of the States declared to be in insurrection, not,
however, to exceed ten in number, each to receive an annual
salary of $2,500.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Secretary of War, besides assigning clerks of the several
grades mentioned in the law, was authorized to issue,
under regulations which he might himself prescribe, such provisions,
clothing and fuel as might be deemed needful for the
immediate and temporary shelter and supply of destitute and
suffering refugees and freedmen as well as their wives and
children. Any military officer could be detailed to duty under
the act, but without increase of pay or allowances.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was further provided that the commissioner, “under the
direction of the President, shall have authority to set apart,
for the use of loyal refugees and freedmen, such tracts of
land within the insurrectionary States as shall have been
abandoned, or to which the United States shall have acquired
title by confiscation or sale, or otherwise, and to every
male citizen, whether refugee or freedman, as aforesaid, there
shall be assigned not more than forty acres of such land,
and the person to whom it was so assigned shall be protected
in the use and enjoyment of the land for the term of three
years at an annual rent not exceeding six per centum upon
the value of said land, as it was appraised by the State authorities
in the year 1860, for the purpose of taxation, and
in case no such appraisal can be found, then the rental shall
be based upon the estimated value of the land in said year,
to be ascertained in such manner as the commissioner may
by regulation prescribe. At the end of said term, or at any
time during said term, the occupants of any parcels so assigned
may purchase the land, and receive such title thereto
as the United States can convey, upon paying therefor the
value of the land, as ascertained and fixed for the purpose of
determining the annual rent aforesaid.”<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c010'><sup>[425]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>It was made the duty of the assistant commissioners to
submit a quarterly report of their proceedings to the commissioner,
who in turn was required to report annually to the
President before the commencement of each regular session
of Congress. Special reports might from time to time be
requested of either the head of the bureau or his subordinates.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bureau thus established was organized principally by
officers of the regular army under direction of General
Oliver O. Howard, who had been selected by President Johnson
as commissioner. It soon grew to vast proportions.
At first it was economically managed and beneficent in its
influence; subsequently, however, it degenerated into an
abuse. Interesting and instructive as would be an inquiry
into its operations, the history of this politico-philanthropic
experiment does not fall within the limits of this work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the adjournment, February 27, 1861, of the Peace
Convention, which had been in session at Washington endeavoring
to discover, if possible, a means of avoiding the
irrepressible conflict, there was a large class who believed that
if only they had been directing the policy of Government the
outbreak could have been averted; even when war was flagrant
and passions were highest this class, though diminished greatly
in numbers, did not altogether despair of effecting a settlement
between the sections. Besides these well-meaning
patriots there were not a few who were ambitious of notoriety
or possessed of an undue opinion of their own importance.
Persons of both classes attempted from time to time to bring
about an armistice which would facilitate negotiations between
the two governments. The efforts of these men have no further
bearing on the subject of reconstruction than as they
serve to show Mr. Lincoln’s views in successive stages of the
conflict.</p>

<p class='c000'>Prominent among these attempts was the Jacquess-Gilmore
mission, which has been described in an interesting volume
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>of Rebellion reminiscences by one of the participants.<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c010'><sup>[426]</sup></a>
Horace Greeley’s career as a diplomat is also a familiar story,
which at once illustrates the guilelessness of the editor and
the sagacity of the President. Mr. Greeley’s failure at Niagara
Falls, however, did not discourage a similar undertaking
by Hon. Jeremiah S. Black, who, with no greater success,
had an interview in Canada with his former friend Jacob
Thompson.<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c010'><sup>[427]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>More important, because of its consequences, than the
work of any of these volunteer commissioners was the visit
of Francis P. Blair, Sr., to Richmond. This distinguished
politician and editor had in the days of Nullification assisted
in shaping the policy of the Government. The bosom friend
and confidential adviser of Andrew Jackson, Mr. Blair
thoroughly understood Southern feeling, and from long
residence in Washington was intimately acquainted with
Southern leaders. His political victories in the past encouraged,
no doubt, the hope of some notable achievement
to crown his maturer years. For some time he had been
meditating a plan of reunion which would not only end the
strife but contribute to heal the wounds of war. Though
anxious to communicate his project to the President, he received
no encouragement to do so. By requesting Blair to
call upon him after the fall of Savannah Mr. Lincoln evaded
a discussion of the subject. That contingency, however, was
not remote, and late in December the veteran political leader
received from the President a card bearing these words:</p>

<p class='c013'>Allow the bearer, F. P. Blair, Sr., to pass our lines, go South, and
return.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>A. Lincoln.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>December 28, 1864.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>With this credential Mr. Blair went at once to the camp
of General Grant, whence under flags of truce he sent two
communications to Jefferson Davis requesting, among other
things, permission for an interview. This, after some delay,
was granted, and on the 12th of January, 1865, he found
himself in Richmond face to face with the Confederate President.
What transpired is accurately known from accounts
of the meeting by both Blair and Davis. The former admitted
frankly that Mr. Lincoln afforded him no opportunity
to explain the object of his mission, and, indeed, appeared
anxious to avoid an interview on that subject. When he had
been assured that the Confederate authorities were under no
engagements to European powers that would prevent their
entering into arrangements with the Government of the
United States Mr. Blair unfolded his plan by reading to
Mr. Davis a carefully prepared paper embodying the following
suggestions:</p>

<p class='c000'>Slavery, he said, was doomed, for even the South itself had
proposed to employ the slave in winning its independence.
That institution, therefore, no longer remained as an obstacle
to peace. Louis Napoleon, he continued, had declared publicly
that his object was to make the Latin race supreme in
the southern part of North America. This, indeed, had been
an idea of the Emperor’s uncle, who desired at one time to
make conquests of territory in the States bordering the Gulf,
and the foothold already effected in Mexico was one step in
the accomplishment of this grand design. After developing
these points Mr. Blair added, “Jefferson Davis is the fortunate
man who now holds the commanding position to encounter
this formidable scheme of conquest, and whose fiat
can at the same time deliver his country from the bloody
agony now covering it in mourning. He can drive Maximilian
from his American throne, and baffle the designs of
Napoleon to subject our Southern people to the ‘Latin race.’”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>How this was to be accomplished Mr. Blair’s paper outlined.
President Lincoln’s amnesty proclamation looked to
an armistice, which could be enlarged to embrace all engaged
in the war; then by secret preliminaries to a cessation of
hostilities Mr. Davis could transfer to Texas such a portion
of the Confederate army as was deemed adequate to his
purpose. With a Southern force on the Rio Grande and
Juarez conciliated it could enter Mexico and expel her invaders.
If these combined forces were insufficient, multitudes
from the Federal army, officers and men, would be
found ready to engage in the enterprise. Both Republicans
and Democrats of the North had declared their adherence to
the Monroe Doctrine.</p>

<p class='c000'>After thus indicating for Mr. Davis a means of escape
from his dilemma the adroit politician next appealed powerfully
to his desire of fame. “He who expels the Bonaparte-Hapsburg
dynasty from our Southern flank,” proceeded Mr.
Blair, “which General Jackson in one of his letters warned
me was the vulnerable point through which foreign invasion
would come, will ally his name with those of Washington
and Jackson as a defender of the liberty of the country. If
in delivering Mexico he should model its States in form and
principle to adapt them to our Union and add a new Southern
constellation to its benignant sky while rounding off our
possessions on the continent at the Isthmus, and opening the
way to blending the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific, thus
embracing our Republic in the arms of the ocean, he would
complete the work of Jefferson, who first set one foot of our
colossal Government on the Pacific by a stride from the Gulf
of Mexico.”<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c010'><sup>[428]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Blair remarked in conclusion, “There is my problem, Mr.
Davis; do you think it possible to be solved?” After a little
consideration came the reply, “I think so.” Touching the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>question of bringing the sections together again Mr. Davis
observed that though a spirit of vindictiveness had been engendered
by the war, time and events would do something
toward its removal. The circumstance of Northern and
Southern armies united in a common cause would, he believed,
assist greatly in restoring the old feeling. He also
acknowledged to his visitor that European powers were
pleased to see the sections exhausting their resources in
mutual war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus was the Confederate leader persuaded to entertain
the bold project of conquering Mexico under pretence of
relieving the Monroe Doctrine from its peril. The explanation
of this easy conversion, however, lies mainly in the fact
that Mr. Davis, however he might endeavor to conceal his
convictions, was convinced that the resources of the South
were scarcely equal to another campaign. Like other leaders
of the Confederacy he was anxious to seize any means of
escape from an embarrassing situation. He proposed to Mr.
Blair, therefore, the appointment of commissioners, and mentioned
Judge Campbell, formerly of the United States Supreme
Court, as one qualified by his talents and integrity
to undertake such a mission.</p>

<p class='c000'>During his short sojourn in Richmond Mr. Blair learned
from other prominent secessionists the hopelessness of the
rebellion, and this, perhaps, was the only tangible result of
his celebrated intrigue. To initiate the project Mr. Davis
handed him a letter to be shown President Lincoln. That
interesting communication was as follows:</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Richmond, Virginia</span>, <em>12 Jany., ’65</em>.</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>F. P. Blair</span>, Esq.:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>: I have deemed it proper, and probably desirable to you, to give
you, in this form, the substance of remarks made by me, to be repeated
by you to President Lincoln, etc., etc. I have no disposition to find
obstacles in forms, and am willing now, as heretofore, to enter into
negotiations for the restoration of peace; and am ready to send a commission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>whenever I have reason to suppose it will be received, or to
receive a commission, if the United States Government shall choose to
send one. That, notwithstanding the rejection of our former offers, I
would, if you could promise that a commissioner, minister, or other agent,
would be received, appoint one immediately, and renew the effort to enter
into conference, with a view to secure peace to the two countries.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours, etc.,</div>
      <div class='line in6'><span class='sc'>Jefferson Davis</span>.<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c010'><sup>[429]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Lincoln’s only response to the communication thus
brought to his attention was to open a little wider the door
for negotiation by sending to Mr. Blair the following letter:</p>

<div class='c011'><span class='sc'>Washington</span>, <em>January 18, 1865</em>.</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>F. P. Blair</span>, Esq.:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>: You having shown me Mr. Davis’s letter to you of the 12th instant,
you may say to him that I have constantly been, am now, and
shall continue ready to receive any agent whom he, or any other influential
person now resisting the National authority, may informally send to
me, with the view of securing peace to the people of our one common
country.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours, etc.,</div>
      <div class='line in4'><span class='sc'>A. Lincoln</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>With this note Mr. Blair returned to Richmond framing
as best he could excuses why President Lincoln rejected the
overtures of Jefferson Davis for a joint invasion of Mexico.
With the nature of these explanations this essay is not concerned.
To cover his retreat from an unsuccessful intrigue
the disappointed commissioner then suggested that, perhaps,
Grant and Lee could enter into negotiations for peace with
more assurance of success than politicians could hope to do.
Though Mr. Davis offered no objection to this proposal,
Blair was forced soon after to report that military negotiations
were out of the question.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Confederate leader was then compelled to choose
between obstinate perseverance in his policy of a war for
Southern independence or to accept frankly Mr. Lincoln’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>offer of reunion. Blair’s first visit to Richmond did not
escape observation, and, when his second conference was
known, interest in the purpose of his mission became intense.
Without some effort at negotiation Mr. Davis could not afterward
satisfy the peace party in the South without subjecting
himself to the injurious imputation of preferring war. In
these circumstances, and after consultation with his cabinet,
he authorized Alexander H. Stephens, John A. Campbell and
R. M. T. Hunter to proceed to Washington as a commission
for the purpose of informally conferring with Mr. Lincoln
“upon the issues involved in the existing war, and for the
purpose of securing peace to the two countries.” They were
burdened with no instructions, and only one condition was
insisted upon, that is, an acknowledgment of Southern independence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward the end of January they presented themselves at
the Federal military lines near Richmond, and, after an
exchange of telegrams with the authorities in Washington,
were permitted to pass on to Fortress Monroe. It was the
original intention of President Lincoln to intrust the work
of the conference wholly to Secretary Seward, and for this
purpose he gave him the following written instructions:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'><span class='sc'>Executive Mansion,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Washington</span>, <em>January 31, 1865</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hon. <span class='sc'>William H. Seward</span>, <em>Secretary of State</em>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>You will proceed to Fortress Monroe, Virginia, there to meet and informally
confer with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, on the
basis of my letter to F. P. Blair, Esq., of January 18, 1865, a copy of
which you have. You will make known to them that three things are indispensable,
to wit: <em>First</em>. The restoration of the national authority
throughout all the States. <em>Second.</em> No receding by the executive of
the United States on the slavery question from the position assumed
thereon in the late annual message to Congress, and in preceding documents.
<em>Third.</em> No cessation of hostilities short of an end of the war
and the disbanding of all forces hostile to the Government. You will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>inform them that all propositions of theirs, not inconsistent with the
above, will be considered and passed upon in a spirit of sincere
liberality. You will hear all they may choose to say and report it to
me. You will not assume to definitely consummate anything.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours, etc.,</div>
      <div class='line in6'><span class='sc'>Abraham Lincoln</span>.<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c010'><sup>[430]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The different if not conflicting statements as to the object
of their mission nearly led to a return of the Confederate
representatives without any interview whatever. General
Grant, fearing the unfavorable influence on the Union cause
of such a result, sent to Secretary Stanton a confidential dispatch
in which he referred to the evident sincerity of Stephens
and Hunter. He also expressed his regret that they
were about to return without an expression on the subject
of their mission from any person in authority. President
Lincoln, who was about to recall Mr. Seward by telegraph,
decided, on reading Grant’s message, to join his Secretary at
Fortress Monroe, for which place he set out at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>The famous conference, which took place February 3,
1865, on board a steamer at Hampton Roads, has been
treated in detail by nearly every historian of the Rebellion,
and, therefore, need only be briefly noticed in these pages.
An informal discussion of four hours occurred on the <em>River
Queen</em>. By a previous agreement no writings or memoranda
were made; hence our principal knowledge of what transpired
at that celebrated interview is derived from accounts subsequently
written out from memory by the Confederate commissioners,
and from Secretary Seward’s letter to Charles
Francis Adams, United States Minister to England.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Stephens, who began the discussion, asked whether
there was no way of restoring former relations; to this Mr.
Lincoln replied, “There was but one way that he knew of,
and that was, for those who were resisting the laws of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>Union to cease that resistance.” Stephens observed that they
had been led to believe that both sections might for a time
cease their present strife and unite on some continental question
until passion had somewhat subsided and accommodation
become possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>To this suggestion Mr. Lincoln replied promptly: “I suppose
you refer to something that Mr. Blair has said. Now
it is proper to state at the beginning that whatever he said
was of his own accord, and without the least authority from
me.” The President then stated that before the visit to
Richmond he had flatly refused to hear Mr. Blair’s propositions;
he was willing, however, to hear proposals for peace
on the conditions expressed in his reply to the letter of Mr.
Davis. The restoration of the Union was a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</span></i> with
him, therefore his instructions that no conference be held
except on that basis.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the Confederate statesmen had resolved not to
enter into any agreement that would require their forces to
unite in an invasion of Mexico, Mr. Stephens continued to
press the subject, and this after Mr. Lincoln had refused
even to discuss the question. The President then brought
the conversation back to the original object of the meeting,
and declared that he could not entertain a proposition looking
to an armistice until the paramount question of reunion
was first determined.</p>

<p class='c000'>The terms of reunion were then discussed. On this subject
Mr. Lincoln is reported by the commissioners to have said
that the shortest way to effect this was to disband the insurgent
armies and permit “the National authorities to resume
their functions.” As to the admission of members to
Congress from the seceding States the President believed
they ought to be received, and also that they would be; however,
he could enter into no stipulations on that subject. By the
cessation of resistance, he is alleged to have declared, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>States would be immediately restored to their practical relations
to the Union. This sentiment was probably ascribed
to him for party purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the enforcement of the confiscation and other penal laws
was left entirely with him he assured them that the Executive
power would be exercised with the utmost liberality.
The courts could determine all questions involving rights of
property, and Congress, after passion had been somewhat composed,
would, no doubt, be liberal in making restitution of
forfeited property, or would indemnify those who had
suffered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The President refused to promise any modification whatever
of the terms of his Emancipation Proclamation. He
regarded it as a judicial question. How the courts would
decide it he did not know. His own opinion was that as the
proclamation was only a war measure, as soon as the war
ceased it would be inoperative for the future. It would be
held to apply only to such slaves as had come under its
operation while it was in active exercise. The courts, however,
might hold that it effectually emancipated all the slaves
in the States to which it applied at the time. He is reported
further to have said that he interfered with slavery to maintain
the Union, and then only with hesitation and under pressure of
a public necessity. He had always favored emancipation, but
not immediate emancipation.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the same occasion he is said to have stated as his
belief that the people of the North were not less responsible
for slavery than those of the South; if the war should then
cease, with the voluntary abolition of slavery by the States,
he would favor, individually, payment by the Government
of a fair indemnity for the loss to owners. That feeling, he
believed, had an extensive existence in the loyal States. He
knew some who were in favor of an appropriation as high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>as $400,000,000 for that purpose. However, he could enter
into no stipulation. He merely expressed his own views
and what he believed to be the views of others upon the
subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>Relative to the division of Virginia Mr. Lincoln said he
could give only “an individual opinion, which was, that
Western Virginia would continue to be recognized as a separate
State in the Union.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Seward brought to the notice of the commissioners one
topic which to them was new, that is, the passage by Congress
three days earlier of the proposed amendment to the
Federal Constitution. He is reported to have said that it
was passed in deference to the war spirit, and that if the
South would agree to immediate restoration its ratification
might be defeated. This, however, is doubtful, for the Cabinet
as well as the President approved the action of Congress
in submitting the Thirteenth Amendment to the consideration
of the States; besides, it is not in harmony with Mr.
Seward’s anti-slavery record.</p>

<p class='c000'>In urging on Mr. Stephens separate State action to effect
a cessation of hostilities, the President said: “If I resided
in Georgia, with my present sentiments, I’ll tell you what I
would do if I were in your place. I would go home and get
the Governor of the State to call the Legislature together,
and get them to recall all the State troops from the war;
elect Senators and Members to Congress, and ratify this
constitutional amendment prospectively, so as to take effect—say
in five years. Such a ratification would be valid, in my
opinion. I have looked into the subject, and think such
a prospective ratification would be valid. Whatever may
have been the views of your people before the war, they must
be convinced now that slavery is doomed. It cannot last long
in any event, and the best course, it seems to me, for your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>public men to pursue would be to adopt such a policy as will
avoid, as far as possible, the evils of immediate emancipation.
This would be my course, if I were in your place.”<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c010'><sup>[431]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The advice was wasted. When the party was on the
point of separating, Mr. Stephens again asked the President
to reconsider the plan of an armistice on the basis of a
Mexican expedition. “Well, Stephens,” replied Mr. Lincoln,
“I will reconsider it; but I do not think my mind will
change.” Thus ended the famous Hampton Roads conference.</p>

<p class='c000'>On their return to Richmond the commissioners made a
formal report to Mr. Davis of the failure of negotiations;
this he transmitted to the Confederate Congress with an
artful letter designed to strengthen the war party in the
South, and to silence effectually the adversaries of his administration.
To improve this advantage a day was appointed
for the purpose of getting a popular expression on
the result of the conference. Business was generally suspended,
and the people crowded every building in the city
suitable for holding large assemblies. Churches, theatres and
halls of legislation were engaged for the occasion. Twenty
orators, among the ablest in the South, told their hearers of
the Northern “ultimatum,” not omitting to describe eloquently
all the consequences of subjugation. The old war
spirit appeared to have been kindled once more; “But,” says
Mr. Pollard, “it was only the sickly glare of an expiring
flame; there was no steadiness in the excitement; there was
no virtue in huzzas; the inspiration ended with the voices
and ceremonies that invoked it; and it was found that the
spirit of the people of the Confederacy was too weak, too
much broken to act with effect, or assume the position of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>erect and desperate defiance.”<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c010'><sup>[432]</sup></a> In March General Lee revealed
the weakness of his army at Fort Steadman; Grant’s
movements around Petersburg followed in April; the rest is a
familiar story.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this brief discussion of topics only allied to the Presidential
method of reunion it is time to resume our examination
of the main theme.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is almost a trite observation to remark that President
Lincoln’s opinions on public questions were formed only after
mature deliberation, and that to the conclusions thus reached
he adhered with inflexible tenacity. Notwithstanding the sentiments
of Congress on the question of reconstruction he
evinced a decided preference for his own. This is proved
by a number of letters and speeches from which two may be
selected both because of the time of their appearance and
the station of the persons to whom they were addressed. To
General Hurlbut, who had temporarily succeeded Banks in
command at New Orleans, the President wrote, November
14, 1864, the following admonitory letter:</p>

<p class='c013'>Few things, since I have been here, have impressed me more painfully
than what, for four or five months past, has appeared a bitter military
opposition to the new State government of Louisiana. I still indulged
some hope that I was mistaken in the fact; but copies of a correspondence
on the subject between General Canby and yourself, and shown
me to-day, dispel that hope. A very fair proportion of the people of
Louisiana have inaugurated a new State government, making an excellent
new constitution—better for the poor black man than we have in
Illinois. This was done under military protection, directed by me, in
the belief, still sincerely entertained, that with such a nucleus around
which to build we could get the State into position again sooner than
otherwise. In this belief a general promise of protection and support,
applicable alike to Louisiana and other States, was given in the last
annual message. During the formation of the new government and constitution
they were supported by nearly every loyal person, and opposed
by every secessionist. And this support and this opposition, from the
respective standpoints of the parties, was perfectly consistent and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>logical. Every Unionist ought to wish the new government to succeed;
and every disunionist must desire it to fail. Its failure would gladden
the heart of Slidell in Europe, and of every enemy of the old flag in the
world. Every advocate of slavery naturally desires to see blasted and
crushed the liberty promised the black man by the new constitution. But
why General Canby and General Hurlbut should join on the same side
is to me incomprehensible.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of course, in the condition of things at New Orleans, the military
must not be thwarted by the civil authority; but when the constitutional
Convention, for what it deems a breach of privilege, arrests an editor in
no way connected with the military, the military necessity for insulting the
Convention and forcibly discharging the editor is difficult to perceive.
Neither is the military necessity for protecting the people against paying
large salaries fixed by a legislature of their own choosing very apparent.
Equally difficult to perceive is the military necessity for forcibly interposing
to prevent a bank from loaning its own money to the State. These
things, if they have occurred, are, at the best, no better than gratuitous
hostility. I wish I could hope that they may be shown to not have
occurred. To make assurance against misunderstanding, I repeat that
in the existing condition of things in Louisiana, the military must not be
thwarted by the civil authority; and I add that on points of difference
the commanding general must be judge and master. But I also add that
in the exercise of this judgment and control, a purpose, obvious and
scarcely unavowed, to transcend all military necessity, in order to crush
out the civil government, will not be overlooked.<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c010'><sup>[433]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A similar communication, though less peremptory in tone,
he felt constrained to send to General E. R. S. Canby, who
had been assigned to command in the military division of
West Mississippi. Under date of December 12, 1864, he
wrote that officer:</p>

<p class='c013'>I think it is probable that you are laboring under some misapprehension
as to the purpose, or rather the motive, of the Government on two
points—cotton and the new Louisiana State government.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is conceded that military operations are the first in importance; and
as to what is indispensable to these operations, the department commander
must be judge and master.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the other matters mentioned I suppose to be of public importance
also; and what I have attempted in regard to them is not merely a
concession to private interest and pecuniary greed.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>As to the new State government of Louisiana. Most certainly there
is no worthy object in getting up a piece of machinery merely to pay
salaries and give political consideration to certain men. But it is a
worthy object to again get Louisiana into proper practical relations with
the nation, and we can never finish this if we never begin it. Much
good work is already done, and surely nothing can be gained by
throwing it away.</p>

<p class='c013'>I do not wish either cotton or the new State government to take
precedence of the military while the necessity for the military remains;
but there is a strong public reason for treating each with so much favor
as may not be substantially detrimental to the military.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c010'><sup>[434]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>That Mr. Lincoln never modified these opinions is conclusively
proved by the last public utterance of his life. In
addressing the citizens of Washington, who were holding a
demonstration in consequence of Lee’s surrender, the President
on the evening of April 11 said:</p>

<p class='c013'>By these recent successes the reinauguration of the national authority—reconstruction—which
has had a large share of thought from the
first, is pressed much more closely upon our attention. It is fraught with
great difficulty. Unlike a case of war between independent nations,
there is no authorized organ for us to treat with—no one man has
authority to give up the rebellion for any other man. We simply must
begin with and mold from disorganized and discordant elements. Nor
is it a small additional embarrassment that we, the loyal people, differ
among ourselves as to the mode, manner, and measure of reconstruction.
As a general rule, I abstain from reading the reports of attacks upon
myself, wishing not to be provoked by that to which I cannot properly
offer an answer. In spite of this precaution, however, it comes to my
knowledge that I am much censured for some supposed agency in setting
up and seeking to sustain the new State government of Louisiana.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this I have done just so much as, and no more than, the public
knows. In the annual message of December, 1863, and in the accompanying
proclamation, I presented a plan of reconstruction, as the
phrase goes, which I promised, if adopted by any State, should be acceptable
to and sustained by the executive Government of the nation.
I distinctly stated that this was not the only plan which might possibly
be acceptable, and I also distinctly protested that the executive claimed
no right to say when or whether members should be admitted to seats
in Congress from such States. This plan was in advance submitted to
the then Cabinet, and distinctly approved by every member of it. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>of them suggested that I should then and in that connection apply the
Emancipation Proclamation to the theretofore excepted parts of Virginia
and Louisiana; that I should drop the suggestion about apprenticeship for
freed people, and that I should omit the protest against my own power
in regard to the admission of members of Congress. But even he approved
every part and parcel of the plan which has since been employed
or touched by the action of Louisiana.</p>

<p class='c013'>The new constitution of Louisiana, declaring emancipation for the
whole State, practically applies the proclamation to the part previously
excepted. It does not adopt apprenticeship for freed people, and it is
silent, as it could not well be otherwise, about the admission of members
to Congress. So that, as it applies to Louisiana, every member of the
Cabinet fully approved the plan. The message went to Congress, and I
received many commendations of the plan, written and verbal, and not a
single objection to it from any professed emancipationist came to my
knowledge until after the news reached Washington that the people of
Louisiana had begun to move in accordance with it. From about July
1862, I had corresponded with different persons supposed to be interested
[in] seeking a reconstruction of a State government for Louisiana.
When the message of 1863, with the plan before mentioned, reached
New Orleans, General Banks wrote me that he was confident that the
people, with his military coöperation, would reconstruct substantially
on that plan. I wrote to him and some of them to try it. They tried
it, and the result is known. Such has been my only agency in getting
up the Louisiana government.</p>

<p class='c013'>As to sustaining it, my promise is out, as before stated. But as bad
promises are better broken than kept, I shall treat this as a bad promise,
and break it whenever I shall be convinced that keeping it is adverse
to the public interest; but I have not yet been so convinced. I have
been shown a letter on this subject, supposed to be an able one, in
which the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to be
definitely fixed on the question whether the seceded States, so called,
are in the Union or out of it. It would perhaps add astonishment to
his regret were he to learn that since I have found professed Union men
endeavoring to make that question, I have purposely forborne any public
expression upon it. As appears to me, that question has not been, nor
yet is, a practically material one, and that any discussion of it, while
it thus remains practically immaterial, could have no effect other than
the mischievous one of dividing our friends. As yet, whatever it may
hereafter become, that question is bad as the basis of a controversy,
and good for nothing at all—a merely pernicious abstraction.</p>

<p class='c013'>We all agree that the seceded States, so called, are out of their proper
practical relation with the Union, and that the sole object of the Government,
civil and military, in regard to those States is to again get them
into that proper practical relation. I believe that it is not only possible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>but in fact easier, to do this without deciding or even considering
whether these States have ever been out of the Union, than with it.
Finding themselves safely at home, it would be utterly immaterial
whether they had ever been abroad. Let us all join in doing the acts
necessary to restoring the proper practical relations between these
States and the Union, and each forever after innocently indulge his
own opinion whether in doing the acts he brought the States from
without into the Union, or only gave them proper assistance, they never
having been out of it. The amount of constituency, so to speak, on
which the new Louisiana government rests, would be more satisfactory to
all if it contained 50,000, or 30,000, or even 20,000, instead of only about
12,000, as it does. It is also unsatisfactory to some that the elective
franchise is not given to the colored man. I would myself prefer that
it were now conferred on the very intelligent, and on those who serve our
cause as soldiers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still, the question is not whether the Louisiana government, as it
stands, is quite all that is desirable. The question is, will it be wiser
to take it as it is and help to improve it, or to reject and disperse it?
Can Louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the Union
sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new State government? Some
twelve thousand voters in the heretofore slave State of Louisiana have
sworn allegiance to the Union, assumed to be the rightful political
power of the State, held elections, organized a State government,
adopted a free State constitution, giving the benefit of public schools
equally to black and white, and empowering the legislature to confer the
elective franchise upon the colored man. Their legislature has already
voted to ratify the constitutional amendment recently passed by Congress,
abolishing slavery throughout the nation. These twelve thousand
persons are thus fully committed to the Union and to perpetual
freedom in the State—committed to the very things, and nearly all the
things, the nation wants—and they ask the nation’s recognition and its
assistance to make good their committal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, if we reject and spurn them, we do our utmost to disorganize
and disperse them. We, in effect, say to the white man: You
are worthless or worse; we will neither help you, nor be helped by you.
To the blacks we say: This cup of liberty which these, your old
masters, hold to your lips we will dash from you, and leave you to the
chances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some vague
and undefined when, where, and how. If this course, discouraging and
paralyzing both white and black, has any tendency to bring Louisiana
into proper practical relations with the Union, I have so far been unable
to perceive it. If, on the contrary, we recognize and sustain the new
government of Louisiana, the converse of all this is made true. We
encourage the hearts and nerve the arms of the twelve thousand to
adhere to their work, and argue for it, and proselyte for it, and fight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>for it, and feed it, and grow it, and ripen it to a complete success. The
colored man, too, in seeing all united for him, is inspired with vigilance,
and energy, and daring, to the same end. Grant that he desires the
elective franchise, will he not attain it sooner by saving the already
advanced steps toward it than by running backward over them? Concede
that the new government of Louisiana is only to what it should
be as the egg is to the fowl, we shall sooner have the fowl by hatching
the egg than by smashing it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again, if we reject Louisiana we also reject one vote in favor of the
proposed amendment to the national Constitution. To meet this proposition
it has been argued that no more than three fourths of those States
which have not attempted secession are necessary to validly ratify the
amendment. I do not commit myself against this further than to say
that such a ratification would be questionable, and sure to be persistently
questioned, while a ratification by three fourths of all the States would
be unquestioned and unquestionable. I repeat the question: Can
Louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the Union
sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new State government?
What has been said of Louisiana will apply generally to other States.
And yet so great peculiarities pertain to each State, and such important
and sudden changes occur in the same State, and withal so new and unprecedented
is the whole case that no exclusive and inflexible plan can
safely be prescribed as to details and collaterals. Such exclusive and
inflexible plan would surely become a new entanglement. Important
principles may and must be inflexible. In the present situation, as the
phrase goes, it may be my duty to make some new announcement to the
people of the South. I am considering, and shall not fail to act when
satisfied that action will be proper.</p>

<p class='c000'>The promised announcement was never made; for within
three days the great career of Abraham Lincoln was brought
to a close. The inherent difficulties of reconstruction, as
well as the mischievous consequences of faction among Union
men, he perceived and acknowledged at the outset. Precisely
how he would have removed the one and, without
breaking with his party, have avoided the other we can never
know. His uniform success in dealing with other embarrassing
questions appears to justify the opinion that he would
not have failed altogether in solving the greater problem presented
by the return of peace. This subject will be further
discussed in the succeeding chapter.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>XII<br /> <span class='large'>CULMINATION OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PLAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Able and candid exponents of public opinion in the
South, even those who were a part of the “Lost
Cause,” are almost unanimous in regarding the
assassination of President Lincoln as one of the greatest
calamities that befell their section of the Union.<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c010'><sup>[435]</sup></a> Indeed,
the writer has heard a distinguished editor ascribe to Jefferson
Davis himself the opinion that next to the failure of the Confederacy
the untimely death of Mr. Lincoln was the severest
blow inflicted on Southern interests.<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c010'><sup>[436]</sup></a> Many of the evils experienced
by their States during the early years of Congressional
reconstruction would have been avoided, they believe,
under a continuance of the wise and considerate policy of the
martyr President. While it is true that the confidence which
he enjoyed among the masses in the loyal States, his unquestionable
integrity and his splendid intellectual powers would
have made him a formidable adversary even in a controversy
with Congress, yet we have no assurance that these undoubted
elements of strength would have enabled him, in the confused
times following the Rebellion, to do more than postpone a contest
with the Legislative branch in which a desire to discipline
the South was even then winning adherents. The passions
of the hour would have discovered a weakness in his clemency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>to the vanquished, while his very breadth of soul and sense
would have been regarded by radical members of his party as
only an evidence of his desire to facilitate the restoration to
power of red-handed rebels. But it is idle to speculate on
what might have been the result of his endeavors to heal the
wounds of war, for, by the assassin’s bullet, the execution of
his policy passed into other hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the terrible tragedy of April 14 was still unknown to
a great majority of American citizens, Andrew Johnson was
quietly installed in the office of President. As every detail
of the simple ceremony in the Kirkwood Hotel is familiar to
this generation of readers, that event requires only a passing
allusion. In the presence of the constitutional advisers of
his predecessor, except Secretary Seward, who had been dangerously
wounded by one of Booth’s accomplices, the oath of
office was administered by Chief Justice Chase, who, with the
Attorney-General, had examined the precedents and the law.
Besides these officials a few members of Congress, who still
lingered at the capital, were in attendance as witnesses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Something of Andrew Johnson’s political career has been
related in the chapter on Tennessee. As military governor
of that State his high courage, his acknowledged patriotism,
his honesty of purpose and principle were evident to all.
Traits of character suspected, but not then fully disclosed,
were developed by more complex conditions. The problem
that confronted him may be briefly stated.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Mr. Johnson succeeded to the Presidential office
Confederate armies somewhat broken, indeed, but still capable
of mischief were retarding the victorious march of Sherman’s
legions. Measures for disbanding the former became necessary
when Southern leaders, recognizing the hopelessness
of further resistance, made overtures looking to an armistice
which took place and to the surrender that subsequently
followed. It became necessary to discontinue at once the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>enlistment of men in the loyal States, and, to economize
expense, to muster out of service as expeditiously as possible
the grand army of Union volunteers. The energy and promptness
with which this task was accomplished were not the least
of Secretary Stanton’s services to the nation. The perfection
to which years of experience had brought the machinery
of the War Department enabled the bulk of the Union armies
to return without delay to their homes, where, discarding the
character of soldiers, they melted insensibly into the civil
population and speedily resumed the pursuits of peace. Relations
with France were somewhat strained, and, owing to a
succession of unfriendly acts, a war with Great Britain was
not improbable. The public finances, too, required attention.
To provide a revenue adequate to the extraordinary demands
of the time was beginning to tax the resources of Government.
A satisfactory settlement of even the least of these might well
have appeared a serious question. The cessation of hostilities,
however, presented a problem far transcending the greatest
of them in importance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the late Confederate States were threatened with
anarchy, for in those commonwealths the recent authority had
been extinguished and no organizations existed which the
Administration could recognize as State governments. The
political reconstruction of four of them, it is true, had been
commenced under encouragement and direction of the national
Executive, but even in those much remained to be done. Before
examining the condition of the insurgent States as a
whole it may be well, therefore, to summarize the most important
events that occurred in Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana
and Virginia between the institution of loyal governments
in those commonwealths and the meeting of the Thirty-ninth
Congress in December, 1865.</p>

<p class='c000'>The General Assembly of Arkansas, though lacking its full
membership, convened in March, 1865, and unanimously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>adopted on April 14 succeeding the proposed amendment to the
Federal Constitution. The action of Congress, however, in
submitting that proposition to the States had been anticipated
by the Union men of that commonwealth, for their organic
law had already abolished involuntary servitude; by the same
instrument they had repudiated all debts created in the conduct
of the war, thereby complying with three of the principal
conditions required for restoring their State to the Union.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the same session an act passed the Legislature disfranchising
all citizens who had aided the Confederate cause
after the organization, April 18, 1864, of a loyal government.
By the adversaries of this measure it was claimed that the
lawmaking body exceeded its powers, because the act in
effect prescribed qualifications for the suffrage different from
those required by the State constitution, and, so far as it
attempted to deprive citizens of their privileges without
judicial conviction of crime, was contrary to the law of the
land. This statute awakened the indifferent, and, as the time
approached for holding Congressional elections, excited considerable
discussion.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the mean time the new government silently extended its
authority over those parts of the State occupied by Southern
soldiers until the cessation of hostilities. Governor Flanigan
on retiring suggested that Confederate county officers be continued
under his successor. This proposal, however, was
promptly rejected and the secession establishment in all its
parts completely ignored. Governor Murphy then published
a proclamation urging the people in those regions hitherto
dominated by the enemy, which comprised nearly half the
counties in the State, to assemble and renew their local organizations.
His address was favorably received, and his administration
soon acquiesced in throughout the commonwealth.
Outrages ceased with the disappearance of Confederate
soldiers, and by the beginning of July judicial tribunals had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>been revived in nearly every county. Some of the courts had
been in session, and most of them were prepared to meet
regularly for the transaction of business. Taxes were collected
as quietly as before the war, and civil process could be
executed in every part of the State. Hundreds had returned
from the South to their former homes and resumed the pursuits
of peace. Discontent, so far as any existed in the
State, was confined to some ex-Confederate officers and to
a few non-combatants who had sympathized with the rebellion.
Both classes advised disregard of the disfranchising
law, but as a rule the returned soldiers on both sides were
quiet and orderly. All accounts concur in representing the
pacification of Arkansas as complete toward the end of summer,
and by October 13, 1865, the Secretary of State was able
to report officially that the new government was in successful
operation, the civil organization of every county having
been effected. Governor Murphy in approving a circular published
near the close of the same month by Brigadier General
Sprague, an assistant commissioner of the Freedmen’s Bureau,
enjoined both civil officers and citizens to give all possible
encouragement to the officers and appointees of the bureau.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c010'><sup>[437]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The President on receiving intelligence of this satisfactory
condition of affairs sent to Governor Murphy the following
dispatch:</p>

<p class='c013'>There will be no interference with your present organization of State
government. I have learned from E. W. Gantt, Esq., and other sources,
that all is working well, and you will proceed and resume the former
relations with the Federal Government, and all the aid in the power of the
Government will be given in restoring the State to its former relations.<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c010'><sup>[438]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As the time approached for an election of national Representatives,
the Governor issued another address in which he
advised the choice of persons who could take the oath required
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>by Congress. Three members were elected, namely: William
Ryers, G. H. Kyle and James M. Johnson, who subsequently
appeared at Washington and presented their credentials.<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c010'><sup>[439]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The foregoing account of the situation in Arkansas is confirmed
by the testimony of General Reynolds, military commander
of the department, who had sent officers into all the
counties. These reported civil government as everywhere
reëstablished. The State, they asserted, had never enjoyed
greater tranquillity. There was not a shadow of conflict between
the civil and the military authority, for the latter in
sustaining the former was careful not to encroach on any of
its functions. In short, the restoration of civil law in that
State was universally admitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>In two thirds of the counties, however, great destitution
prevailed. Early in the summer the General Government felt
compelled to distribute among indigent freedmen and refugees
vast quantities of food, and Northern generosity alone, the
Governor declared, could prevent great distress during the
ensuing winter. Nor was his expectation disappointed. It
is a splendid tribute to the character of Americans that one of
the most destructive conflicts in history, with all the animosities
which protracted civil wars engender, did not perceptibly
impair in them the feelings of humanity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The organization of a Union government in Tennessee has
elsewhere been described. The Assembly chosen under its
authority met at Nashville on the 2d of April, 1865, and
three days later ratified the Thirteenth Amendment. On the
21st the President was requested to proclaim the insurrection
at an end in that commonwealth, though a few weeks later he
was called upon for troops to guarantee a republican form of
government and to protect the State against invasion and
domestic violence. Besides appointing executive officers the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>Legislature elected to the United States Senate David T. Patterson
and Joseph S. Fowler.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most important measure of the session, however, was
the enactment on June 5 of a severe law affecting the elective
franchise. By it the right to vote was restricted, as formerly,
to white males who had attained their twenty-first year. To
the classes excepted by the Proclamation of December 8, 1863,
were added all those who had left seats in the General Assembly,
all who were absentees from the United States for the
purpose of aiding the rebellion and all who had fled within
the Confederate lines with the same intention. These were
disfranchised for the period of fifteen years from the passage
of the act.<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c010'><sup>[440]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>During this session there was presented by the freedmen
of the State a petition for the elective franchise. The “colored
citizens of Tennessee,” as they styled themselves, received
no response to their prayer beyond the approval of
an order for printing 500 copies of their memorial. The motion
for this trifling concession was carried by a vote of 41
to 10.</p>

<p class='c000'>On June 12 the Legislature adjourned until the first Monday
in October. On the same day Governor Brownlow ordered
an election to be held on August 2 for Representatives
to Congress in each of the eight districts into which the
State had just been divided. Vacancies in the General Assembly
were directed to be filled at the same time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The disfranchising act, with the oath required thereunder,
had the effect of excluding a large number, probably three
fourths, of the citizens from voting. Its adversaries declared
the law unconstitutional, and it encountered much opposition,
especially in Middle and West Tennessee. Its constitutionality,
however, was sustained by one of the State courts in a
decision rendered June 29, and the Governor, in a proclamation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>of July 10 succeeding, argued in favor of the statute.
Those who should unite to defeat its execution would be “declared
in rebellion against the State of Tennessee, and dealt
with as rebels.” It was further signified that votes cast in
violation of the law would not be taken into account by the
Secretary of State.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor were these idle threats, for the civil officers were
instructed “to arrest and bring to justice all persons who,
under pretence of being candidates for Congress or other
office, are traveling over the State denouncing and nullifying
the Constitution and laws of the land, and spreading sedition
and a spirit of rebellion.”<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c010'><sup>[441]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It was relative to these measures that President Johnson
on July 20, 1865, sent the following despatch to Governor
Brownlow:</p>

<p class='c013'>I hope and have no doubt you will see that the recent amendments
to the constitution of the State as adopted by the people, and all the
laws passed by the last Legislature in pursuance thereof, are fairly
executed, and that all illegal votes in the approaching election be
excluded from the polls, and the election for members of Congress be
legally and fairly conducted. When and wherever it becomes necessary
to employ force for the execution of the laws and the protection of
the ballot-box from violence and fraud, you are authorized to call
upon Maj.-Gen. Thomas for sufficient military force to sustain the
civil authorities of the State. I have received your recent address to
the people, and think it well timed, and hope it will do much good in
reconciling the opposition to the amendment to the constitution and the
laws passed by the last Legislature. The law must be executed and the
civil authority sustained. In your efforts to do this, if necessary, Gen.
Thomas will afford a sufficient military force. You are at liberty to
make what use you think proper of this despatch.<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c010'><sup>[442]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Though no violence marked the election, considerable
irregularities, notwithstanding the Governor’s precautions, appear
to have crept into modes of registration, and he felt compelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>in consequence to reject the ballots of twenty-nine
counties. In this contest 61,783 citizens participated, but
when those illegally enrolled were disregarded the number
was reduced to 39,509. The defective vote, which applied to
all the candidates, was thrown out in every county, though it
changed the result in only one district. Of the eight Representatives
chosen all were Union men; four, however, were
conservatives, opposed both to test oaths and measures of
disfranchisement.<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c010'><sup>[443]</sup></a> Governor Brownlow because of his action
was severely censured, but was supported by a majority of
the General Assembly.</p>

<p class='c000'>In October, when the Legislature reassembled, a bill to
render persons of African and of Indian descent competent
witnesses in the State courts passed the Senate by the close
vote of 10 to 9, but failed altogether to receive the approval
of the House. The Representatives of his State declined at
that time, by a vote of 35 to 25, to pass a simple resolution
endorsing the Administration of President Johnson, but almost
unanimously adopted in place of that proposition the
following:</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Resolved</em>, That we endorse the administration of his Excellency the
President of the United States, and especially his declaration that treason
shall be made odious, and traitors punished.<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c010'><sup>[444]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A colored convention representing the freedmen of the
State was held at the capital during the week succeeding the
election. If the Legislature did not grant before December 1,
1865, their petition for the elective franchise, this body resolved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>to protest against the admission of the Tennessee delegation
to Congress. On the question of negro suffrage the
Governor in his October message said:</p>

<p class='c013'>I think it would be bad policy, as well as wrong in principle, to open
the ballot-box to the uninformed and exceedingly stupid slaves of the
Southern cotton, rice, and sugar fields. If allowed to vote, the great
majority of them would be influenced by leading secessionists to vote
against the Government, as they would be largely under the influence o£
this class of men for years to come, having to reside on and cultivate
their lands. When the people of Tennessee become satisfied that the
negro is worthy of suffrage, they will extend it, and not before; and I
repeat that this question must be regulated by the State authorities and by
the loyal voters of the State, not by the General Government.<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c010'><sup>[445]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Apprehending trouble from the antagonism of races Mr.
Brownlow advocated the old idea of colonization for the
black man. He believed, however, that negroes should be admitted
to testify in the courts and argued in favor of conferring
such a privilege. Repugnance to their testimony, he
declared, was due principally to education and habit.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the following account from <cite>The Knoxville Whig</cite> of
September 27 is trustworthy the freedmen of Tennessee had
but a slender claim to the right to vote. That journal said:</p>

<p class='c013'>Thousands of free colored persons are congregating in and around the
large towns in Tennessee, and thousands are coming in from other
States, one third of whom cannot get employment. Indeed, less than
one third of them want employment, or feel willing to stoop to work.
They entertain the erroneous idea that the Government is bound to
supply all their wants, and even to furnish them with houses, if, in
order to do that, the white occupants must be turned out. There is a
large demand for labor in every section of the State, but the colored
people, with here and there a noble exception, scorn the idea of work.
They fiddle and dance at night, and lie around the stores and street
corners in the day time.<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c010'><sup>[446]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Governor’s message, sent in at this session, was hopeful
in tone. He favored some amendment but not a repeal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>of the franchise law. He advised also a “full pardon to the
masses—the young and the deluded, who followed blindly
the standard of revolt, provided they act as becomes their circumstances.”
The unrepentant, however, should suffer the
period of disfranchisement; while the active leaders, he believed,
were entitled “neither to mercy nor forbearance.” To
some negroes he would give the right of suffrage, but, believing
it unsafe, he was opposed to conferring it on them all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tennessee, over which advancing and retreating armies had
repeatedly passed, suffered even more severely than Arkansas,
for besides having been the principal theatre of operations for
the contending hosts in the West, her territory had also been
in the early rule of Governor Johnson the scene of local
strife. Old family feuds that for various reasons had been
allowed to slumber were in many instances revived, and the
most lawless outrages perpetrated in the face of day. These
disorders, however, had practically ceased toward the conclusion
of his governorship, and peace reigned once more
within the borders of that community. The existence there
of a considerable demand for labor assisted greatly in diminishing
the burden of the authorities.</p>

<p class='c000'>The closing months of the war found the loyal government
of Louisiana endeavoring with the influence of the Union
army to extend its jurisdiction over all the territory that had
been brought under Federal control. Notwithstanding its
contracted area this commonwealth for certain purposes was
treated as a restored member of the Union. Like the Northern
States it was affected by the draft which, on February 15, took
place in some districts included in the Department of the
Gulf. But the great struggle that for four years had employed
the attention and tested the resources of the Government
soon reached its close, thus rendering unnecessary any
field service from the recruits then obtained.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the attitude of Congress toward the Banks government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>has been described in the preceding pages, that was
not believed the proper place to examine the nature of the
election which was held on September 5, or the <em>personnel</em>
of the Legislature chosen on that occasion. In connection
with the appointment by that assembly of Messrs. Smith and
Cutler as United States Senators the subject was noticed incidentally.
The action of Congress on the question of admitting
members from Louisiana was, however, fully entered
into in that relation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some additional information affecting the validity of that
election is afforded by a proclamation published May 13, 1865,
by the acting Governor, J. Madison Wells.<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c010'><sup>[447]</sup></a> This document asserts
that the Register of Voters for the city of New Orleans
declared officially that there had been enrolled 5,000 persons
who did not possess the legal qualifications for electors. To
ascertain the political people, therefore, a new registration was
thought desirable. Mr. Wells accordingly declared the old
records closed from the date of his proclamation. The certificates
granted thereon, as well as the enrollment, were pronounced
null and void. He then authorized the opening on
June 1, 1865, of a new set of books, the enrollment to be made
in accordance with the qualifications prescribed by the constitution
and laws of Louisiana. The old registration having
been made under an order of General Banks this announcement
led at once to a difference between the Department Commander
and the acting Governor. Many names recorded on
the old books were alleged to have been those of colored men,
and a circumstance presently to be related tends to support
the assertion.</p>

<p class='c000'>About that time the Confederate Governor, Allen, transferred
to Federal officials all the important military records
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>in his possession, and from his capital at Shreveport published
a communication in which he announced his administration
closed on that day. He said in part: “The war is over,
the contest is ended, the soldiers are disbanded and gone
home, and now there is in Louisiana no opposition whatever
to the Constitution and laws of the United States.”<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c010'><sup>[448]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On June 10 an address to the people of thirty-five parishes
was issued by the new Governor, who congratulated them on
their return to the protection of the national flag. It was
not with the past, he reminded them, but with the present and
the future that their welfare was bound up. They were exhorted
to go manfully to work and reëstablish civil government.
The submission to law and the prompt acquiescence
of those recently hostile to the United States he regarded
as a hopeful sign. Even the soldiers, he said, returned to
their homes better and wiser men, promising by a cheerful
obedience to law to atone for past errors. All citizens were
urged to imitate their example. Provisional appointments
to county offices would be made until they could be filled by
election. In naming persons for such places the Governor
promised to be guided by the recommendation of the people
if they selected men of good reputation who had taken the
amnesty oath, which would be a prerequisite in every case. If
the people did not act promptly he would feel compelled to
make appointments upon the best information obtainable. If
errors were made, then citizens would be themselves to blame
for neglecting promptly to suggest the proper persons. A
provisional judiciary would also be constituted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Important elections, he announced, would take place in
the autumn, when Representatives to Congress and members
of a Legislature would be chosen. If each parish was provided
with the proper officers to open the polls an election
for governor and other State officers would take place at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>same time. The people addressed were informed that in
making the new constitution its framers did not intend to
deprive them of their rights. The response to this appeal
was a local reorganization in nearly all the parishes affected.</p>

<p class='c000'>Governor Wells, on September 21, in a second order appointed
the 6th of November succeeding as the day for holding
the election, and also defined the qualifications of voters.
White male citizens of the United States who had attained the
age of twenty-one years and had resided twelve months in
the commonwealth were declared entitled to exercise the
suffrage. Evidence was also required of every elector that
he had taken the oath of amnesty contained in the proclamation
of December 8, 1863, or that prescribed, May 29, 1865,
by Mr. Johnson. The excepted classes could vote only upon
receiving a special pardon from the President. In other
respects the election would be conducted in accordance with
the constitution of 1852.</p>

<p class='c000'>By a Democratic convention, held October 2 in New Orleans,
at which twenty-one parishes were unrepresented, Mr.
Wells was unanimously nominated for Governor. The preamble
to a body of resolutions adopted on that occasion asserts
that the issue which for four years had tried the strength of
the Government had been made openly and manfully; that
the decision having been adverse they now came forward in
the same spirit of frankness and honor to support the Federal
Government under the Constitution.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “National Democratic” party they believed to be the
only agency by which radicalism, to which they imputed a
tendency toward consolidation, could be successfully encountered,
and through which the General Government could be
restored to its pristine purity. On the subject of reorganization
they endorsed President Johnson’s policy, which, it was
alleged, preserved unimpaired the rights of the States and
maintained their equality in the Union.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>Noticing a question already assuming importance, they
declared that, in accordance with the constant adjudication
of the Federal Supreme Court, persons of African descent
could not be regarded as citizens of the United States; that
under no circumstances could there exist any equality between
the white and other races; that as the national Government
was instituted by, so it was designed to be perpetuated for
the exclusive benefit of, white men. For the time they were
content with this oblique reference to the subject of negro
suffrage. Another resolution advised the calling of a convention
to frame a constitution for the State, that of 1864
being characterized as the creation of fraud, violence and corruption.</p>

<p class='c000'>This convention, which admitted the effectual abolition of
slavery in the South, assumed that those who had sustained
loss by the policy of emancipation could rightfully petition
Congress for compensation. The repeal was also advocated
of those statutes and ordinances not in harmony with the
Federal Constitution. Believing it consonant with “the chivalrous
magnanimity” of President Johnson the convention
earnestly appealed for an early general amnesty and a prompt
restitution of property.</p>

<p class='c000'>Almost a month preceding the meeting of this convention
an address was circulated by the “National Conservative
Union” party, whose representatives assembled one week
later than the Democratic delegates. Its members opposed
both an extension of suffrage to negroes and the calling of
a new constitutional convention. Like the Democratic delegates
they endorsed the reconstruction policy of the President.
They approved the attitude of their conservative Northern
friends who opposed radicalism and an elevation of the
freedmen to political equality with whites. The doctrine of
secession was repudiated, and to the payment of all obligations
created in carrying on the war they declared themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>inflexibly opposed. They, too, favored the speedy passage
of an act of general amnesty as well as a repeal of the confiscation
law.</p>

<p class='c000'>Governor Wells was also the choice of this convention. He
accepted both nominations and perceived no inconsistency in
doing so, never, he asserted, having been a strict party man.
Mr. Wells, who had formerly been a Red River planter,
proved his loyalty to the Federal Government by coming
within the Union lines as soon as they were established, and
bringing with him his slaves, thereby endangering somewhat
his ownership.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though he had not yet returned to his home, the friends
of Henry Watkins Allen, the late Confederate executive,
named him as their candidate for governor.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the election, which was held at the appointed time, the
entire vote polled was 27,808, of which Governor Wells received
23,312, and ex-Governor Allen, 5,497. In every county
except one the Democratic ticket for members of the Legislature
was successful.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps the most instructive incident of this contest was
the part played by those known as “Radical” Republicans.
These held a mass-meeting in the city of New Orleans on
November 13 at which were adopted resolutions claiming the
election to Congress of Henry C. Warmoth as territorial
Delegate. When he subsequently appeared in Washington
his case was brought to the attention of the House by Thaddeus
Stevens, who offered, December 20, 1865, what purported
to be a certificate of Warmoth’s election as Delegate
from the “Territory of Louisiana.” On request of the
Pennsylvania leader this document was referred to the Joint
Committee on Reconstruction.<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c010'><sup>[449]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This extreme element, which assumed to regard Louisiana
as a Territory, polled 19,000 votes, most of which were alleged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>to have been cast by colored men. It declared the State organization
repugnant to the Federal Constitution both in law
and effect. The President, it was asserted, could not restore
Louisiana by proclamation, for reinstatement could be accomplished
in a constitutional manner only by petitioning
Congress for admission whenever a majority of the people
deemed such a course expedient, and the temper of the whites,
nine tenths of whom were disloyal, rendered it inadvisable
at that time to take such a step. The meeting rejoiced that
the Republican party in the North had triumphed in the
recent elections, for these victories pointed to ultimate success.
The premature admission of Louisiana Congressmen,
by placing the Union people under rebel rule, would be disastrous.
However, as loyal citizens they would confine themselves
to peaceable means of redress.</p>

<p class='c000'>Warmoth appears shortly before the end of the war to have
gone into Louisiana with the Union army, in which he is
said by one authority to have acquired the reputation of a
brave soldier and by another to have merited dismissal from
its ranks.<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c010'><sup>[450]</sup></a> By organizing the freedmen and insisting upon
their political rights he won their confidence; his shrewdness
and engaging address retained their gratitude. In this election
his adherents not only sought to determine the Federal relations
of Louisiana, but also conferred upon negroes the privilege
of voting, for there was then no law of either the General
or State government investing them with any such right.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Legislature, which was convoked in special session,
assembled at New Orleans on the 23d of November. The
Governor’s message on that occasion related chiefly to such
local objects as required the attention of the lawmaking body.
By recommending an election of United States Senators Mr.
Wells repudiated the action of the General Assembly, which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>at the preceding session, had appointed Messrs. Smith and
Cutler to represent the State. Acting upon the Governor’s
suggestion, the latter was again chosen, with Hahn for his
colleague. These appointments were intended to fill vacancies
caused by the withdrawal, February 5, 1861, of John Slidell
and Judah P. Benjamin.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the first acts of the lower House was the selection
of a committee to consider a resolution which provided for
assembling a convention to draft a State constitution. For
reasons already assigned the majority report of this committee
recommended the calling of a convention and counselled
the Governor to order an election in which the question
could be voted on by the people. The minority recognized the
constitution of 1864 as binding, and on the ground of public
economy preferred its amendment, especially as it had already
acted favorably on the abolition of slavery. The adoption of
the Thirteenth Amendment and the repeal of the ordinance
of secession were mentioned by them as conditions essential
to the recognition of Louisiana as a State and as indispensable
to a restoration of all the privileges which that condition
implied.</p>

<p class='c000'>As early as February 17 preceding the Legislature established
under the constitution of 1864 had ratified the Thirteenth
Article amending the Constitution. By a vote of two
to one the Assembly again approved that action. The session
came to an end on the 22d of December.</p>

<p class='c000'>This commonwealth, a veritable Eden when the strife
began, had been sadly changed in its progress. A generous
Government, indeed, by repairing the levees protected her
fairest parishes from inundation. The same beneficent authority
maintained many public institutions of charity that
must else have ceased their noble work. Distress and want
had already invaded that once prosperous community, and in
the city of New Orleans alone 16,000 persons were dependent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>upon and maintained by Federal bounty. Silence reigned in
the great cotton market of the world. The wreck of her
public finances has elsewhere been described. Her opulent
commerce had been destroyed, agriculture everywhere languished.
Plantations that but lately teemed with rich harvests
showed the effects of interrupted cultivation, and the
mighty river that had annually poured into her metropolis
the productions of a dozen States now flowed untroubled to
the Gulf.</p>

<p class='c000'>To show the attitude of Congress toward the Alexandria
government events in Virginia have in part been anticipated.
The Legislature of the loyal portion of that Commonwealth
was composed of members from only ten counties and parts
of other counties. It was by delegates from this restricted
area that the constitution of 1864 was framed and adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this instrument the elective franchise was confined to
male whites that had attained the age of twenty-one years,
who had resided twelve months in the State and were willing
to swear support of the Federal Constitution and the restored
government; but officials and voters were required in addition
to make oath, or affirmation, that they had not, since
January 1, 1864, voluntarily given aid or assistance to those
in rebellion against the General Government. The Assembly,
however, was empowered, when it was deemed safe to do
so, to restore to citizenship all who would be disfranchised
by this provision of the organic law.</p>

<p class='c000'>Involuntary servitude was also abolished. While great
numbers of negroes were thus set at liberty, nothing was
then done to elevate them to the dignity of citizens. The
question of making them voters was, of course, still more remote.</p>

<p class='c000'>The General Assembly was prohibited from making provision
for the payment of any debt or obligation created in
the name of the Commonwealth by the pretended State authorities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>at Richmond; and it was also forbidden to permit any
county, city or corporation to levy or collect taxes for the
discharge of any debt incurred for the purpose of aiding any
rebellion against the State or the United States, or to provide
for the payment of any bonds held by rebels in arms.<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c010'><sup>[451]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Confederate capital, long deemed impregnable, fell
on the 2d of April. Within a week came tidings of the
surrender of Lee’s entire army, greatly reduced in numbers,
it is true, but hitherto the main reliance of the Confederacy.
Mr. Lincoln, apparently, was not altogether without expectation
of some such fortunate outcome of the extensive preparations
that had been made for ensuring the success of the final
campaign, and on the following day, April 10, 1865, he sent
from Washington to the executive head of the restored State
this telegram:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Governor Pierpont</span>, <em>Alexandria, Virginia</em>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Please come up and see me at once.<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c010'><sup>[452]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>A. Lincoln.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Pierpont, as the writer has been credibly informed,
called by request on President Lincoln during the week of
his assassination, evidently in response to this telegram, when
they spent three hours together in conversation. No third
party appears to have been present at their consultation. The
topic discussed it is not difficult to imagine. Shortly before
his death, which occurred in March, 1899, Governor Pierpont
informed his daughter that he never believed Andrew
Johnson carried out Mr. Lincoln’s idea in the reconstruction
of Virginia.<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c010'><sup>[453]</sup></a> That policy, however, had not then, April 10,
assumed definitive form in the mind of the President himself,
for he expressly stated to Mr. Pierpont that he had no
plan for reorganization, but must be guided by events. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>last public utterance establishes the correctness of this statement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Four weeks later President Johnson by executive order
recognized the Alexandria establishment, and toward the
close of the same month, May 26, 1865, Mr. Pierpont, with
other members of his government, arrived in Richmond.
The sneer of Thaddeus Stevens that the archives and property
of loyal Virginia were conveyed to the new capital in
an ambulance affords at least an adequate idea of the feeble
condition of the restored State. But notwithstanding the
absence of all pomp and his lack of the usual emblems of
authority the Governor, we are told, was received in a very
flattering manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Virginia, which emerged from the struggle crippled by the
loss of an important part of her domain, suffered more in
the destruction of the elements of wealth than any of her
errant sisters, and though entering somewhat reluctantly on
a career of rebellion, she was the only member of the Confederacy
that was permanently weakened. Industry could
never repair the alienation of her territory. While it may
appear that the General Government acted harshly toward
a State to which the Union owed so much, the preceding
pages show clearly that the loss of her trans-Alleghany counties
was due chiefly to an unwise administration of her internal
affairs. Notwithstanding the statement of Mr. Blaine,
the writer does not think that Virginia was singled out for
punishment. But even apart from her dismemberment the
ravages of war fell most heavily on the Old Dominion.
There it was that the Army of the Potomac and the Army
of Northern Virginia contended longest for supremacy.
Troops in their marches and countermarches foraged liberally
on her people, sometimes without distinction of friend
or foe. Concrete illustrations will occur to every reader acquainted
with the military history of the great conflict.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>The devastation of the Shenandoah valley was only a striking
example of what was constantly occurring within more
restricted areas of the State. Barns and dwelling houses,
fences and crops perished in the universal destruction. Cattle
were either killed or carried off, and even the implements of
husbandry were frequently devoted to the flames. The injury
thus sustained by agricultural interests was followed in
many districts by an alarming scarcity of food during the
ensuing years, and to escape starvation numbers of her citizens
fled from once happy homes. Newspaper correspondents in
their progress through the State describe scenes of wretchedness
and distress. In exploring for their journals wide regions
that had recently been the theatre of war they witnessed
spectacles of want, hunger and despair. Uncultivated tracts
in the wake of the armies contributed to heighten the picture
of desolation. Richmond, the centre of so many interesting
historical associations, though long exempt from pillage,
perished ultimately in a conflagration. In short, nearly every
landmark of prosperity was effaced by the calamities of war.</p>

<p class='c000'>To repair these ravages, to repeople these solitudes, to
revive commerce and agriculture, to restore tranquillity and
maintain order was the stupendous task before Governor Pierpont,
in whose public career it may be regarded as the second
stage. After the formation of West Virginia, in which he
had acted a conspicuous and honorable part, and one that
can scarcely be overrated, his exertions barely sufficed to preserve
the continuity of a loyal government in his native State.
In the former undertaking he had the coöperation of nearly
every person of consideration beyond the Alleghanies. His
efforts in Richmond, however, received but indifferent support.
Whites of little influence and negroes who were still
but prospective citizens made up the greater number of his
adherents. A handful of secessionists, it is true, set the example
of obedience to the laws, though they found among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>their late associates but few imitators. It was from such material
and in such circumstances that Mr. Pierpont was to
reconstruct the grand old Commonwealth. The Governor,
however, applied himself at once to the duties imposed by his
office. He appointed persons to reorganize the various counties
by holding elections for local officers, though in numerous
instances he merely authorized to act for the preservation of
peace those citizens whom the military officers might select.
The difficulties of the situation were such that he summoned
the Legislature to meet in special session at Richmond on the
20th of June.</p>

<p class='c000'>In response to this request the lawmaking body assembled
at the appointed time. The Executive message on that occasion
related concisely what had been done by the restored
government subsequent to June, 1861. It also stated that
since his arrival at the capital the Governor had conversed
with intelligent men of every shade of political opinion and
representing every part of Virginia. He was convinced, he
said, that if the test of loyalty prescribed by their constitution
was enforced in the election and qualification of officers,
it would render organization impracticable in most of the
counties. It was folly to suppose that a State could be administered
“under a republican form of government where in
a large portion of the State, nineteen twentieths of the people
are disfranchised and cannot hold office. But, fortunately,
by the terms of the constitution, the General Assembly has
control of this subject. The restricting clauses of the constitution
were devised in time of war.... Men accept
the facts developed by the logic of the past four years, declare
that they have taken the oath of allegiance to the Government
of the United States without mental reservation, and
intend to be, and remain, loyal to the Government of their
fathers. It would not be in accordance with the spirit of that
noble Anglo-Saxon race, from which we boast our common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>origin, to strike a fallen brother, or impose upon him humiliating
terms after a fair surrender.”<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c010'><sup>[454]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>For the oath required by the State constitution he suggested
the substitution of that prescribed by the President, or
one of similar character; he also recommended the passage
of an act to legalize marriage between persons of color, and
the appointment of a day for holding elections of Representatives
to Congress and for members of the Legislature in those
counties where none had been chosen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subject of disfranchisement was immediately taken up
in both Houses, and the result of their action was to allow
the suffrage to those who, upon taking the amnesty oath, had
not held office under the Confederacy or its State governments.
Those who had done so could neither vote nor hold
office. The Legislature submitted to the people, to be determined
at the election in October succeeding, the question
of removing this restriction upon officeholders.</p>

<p class='c000'>This action of the Assembly was followed by the appearance
of a large number of competitors for office, and considerable
interest was awakened. Finding, however, that
they would be unable to take the oath required by Congress
many of the candidates for the national Legislature withdrew.
The President was asked by some citizens of Albemarle
County whether, in his opinion, Congress would probably
insist upon the oath. The following reply to their inquiry
was made by Attorney-General Speed:</p>

<p class='c013'>The President has referred to me your letter, dated Charlottesville,
Virginia, September, 1865, and I am instructed by him to say that he
has no more means of knowing what Congress may do in regard to the
oath about which you inquire than any other citizen. It is his earnest
wish that loyal and true men, to whom no objections can be made, should
be elected to Congress.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is not an official letter, but a simple expression of individual
opinion and wish.<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c010'><sup>[455]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>The election was held on October 12, the vote polled being
the smallest ever given in the history of the State. In the
first eight Congressional districts, however, it exceeded
40,000. The constitutional amendment met with very little
opposition, many counties voting unanimously to remove the
restriction upon the suffrage.<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c010'><sup>[456]</sup></a> The Assembly then chosen
convened at Richmond on December 4, 1865, the time fixed
for the meeting of Congress.</p>

<p class='c000'>While it is true that there were grounds for apprehension
regarding the stability of the new governments instituted in
these four States, the principal cause of anxiety to the Administration
was the disorganized political and social condition
of the remaining members of the late Confederacy. It
was universally agreed that with the destruction of its military
power the authority of that government was completely
extinguished. From that moment until the revival within
them of Federal laws these commonwealths were destitute of
all legislation of a general character. Under our dual principle
of government, however, this could be endured temporarily.
But the absence of a central organism would soon be
evident in the reappearance of those alarming symptoms which
marked American political and industrial life in the critical
period between the Treaty of Paris, in 1783, and the inauguration,
nearly six years later, of the present national system.
In that unhappy interval, however, the authority of the
various States was ample for the regulation of domestic affairs,
while in the deranged and confused times succeeding the Rebellion
seven entire commonwealths were left without any
general or any particular government. Their territory, indeed,
had passed under control of the Union forces, for when
the Administration of Jefferson Davis was overthrown the
disloyal State establishments, of which it was only an emanation,
fell likewise. Though internal progress was not seriously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>to be expected in this situation, tolerable order was preserved
by Federal soldiers, who occupied the entire region
between the Potomac and the Rio Grande, for even in those
States reorganized under Executive auspices civil authority
was not yet established on a foundation sufficiently secure to
maintain itself without assistance from the military power
of the nation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the absence of all civil government there were other
elements of discord that tended to increase the confusion in
these States. Their population, it need scarcely be observed,
was not homogeneous. The decree of emancipation together
with the incidents of war had brought freedom to almost
the entire slave population of the South. This was soon to be
confirmed by the proposed constitutional amendment, which
was designed both to place beyond question the status of freedmen
and to strike the shackles from the limbs of the last
bondman in the loyal as well as in the disloyal States. About
the middle of December nearly 4,000,000 negroes bereft of
the hand that bestowed their daily sustenance found themselves
suddenly dependent for support upon their own exertions.
The General Government, it is true, by creating the
Bureau of Freedmen and Refugees, diminished considerably
the danger from this source, though this relief by no means
solved the problem of transforming the recent slave into a
useful member of society; besides, the bureau itself subsequently
degenerated into a fruitful source of abuse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor were Southern whites by any means unanimous as to
the best policy to adopt in the circumstances in which an unsuccessful
rebellion had placed them. Between Union men
and secessionists there existed a feeling of extreme bitterness.
Even among members of the latter class there was considerable
difference of opinion, as in North Carolina, where the
former Whigs, by the moderation of their views as much as
by constantly agitating the question of reconstruction, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>somewhat embarrassed the Richmond authorities while war
was still flagrant. Add to these causes of disorder the discontent
of thousands of disbanded soldiers who returned in the
gloom of defeat not infrequently to ruined homes and wasted
fields. Then, too, there was the disappointment and humiliation
naturally felt by a brave and impulsive people who had
fought gallantly in support of a cause condemned, indeed, by
the civilized world, but believed by them to be not only just
but indispensable to their prosperity and happiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though a volume could be profitably employed in describing,
town by town and county by county, the extent of destruction
inflicted on the South, a few brief paragraphs must suffice
to suggest an imperfect idea of the enormous loss of wealth
sustained by that section. The wreck of four members of
the Confederacy has been noticed in the preceding pages. That
rapid sketch, however, took no account of the damage to individuals
by the liberation of their slaves, for, except in those
instances where negroes left the commonwealth, that was
not in any sense a loss to the State. If it were, a community,
by reducing to servitude a part of its inhabitants, could at
any time increase the amount of its capital. It is only from
the slaveholder’s point of view, therefore, that emancipation
can be regarded as a pecuniary loss. Immense damage was
sustained by both North and South in the withdrawal of millions
of men from the various fields of production. The energy
of these multitudes, which was rapidly making the United
States the most opulent and powerful nation on the globe,
had exerted itself for four years in the destruction of former
accumulations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Almost at the moment that the star of the Confederacy had
begun to decline the imperial State of Georgia, hitherto exempt
from punishment, was wasted by fire and sword. Sometimes
the Southern, sometimes the Northern army stripped the
country of everything capable of supporting life. Crops had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>been harvested, indeed, but this served only to facilitate their
destruction. In the retreat of Johnston and the advance of
Sherman toward Atlanta highways had been injured, bridges
burned and many lines of railroad completely destroyed.
Dwellings, when they interfered with military operations,
were levelled by even the Confederate army, and the Union
forces could not be expected to show greater consideration
for the property of public enemies. General Hood not only
wasted the vast stores accumulated in Atlanta but burned
habitations when they stood in the way of his fortifications.
Though winter was rapidly approaching, the Federal commander
deemed it necessary after the capture of that stronghold
to expel from their abodes a considerable part of its
population. A brief truce, it is true, enabled the miserable
inhabitants to remove a part of their effects farther south;
thousands, outcasts from their ruined homes, were thus driven
to wander among strangers whose bounty had already been
taxed by earlier fugitives; both classes were dependent for
their maintenance on the precarious charity of an impoverished
people. Crowded dwellings forced great numbers in the
inclement weather to seek shelter in the neighboring forests,
where they found a safe refuge, indeed, but a scanty subsistence.
Over the region traversed by Sherman and Johnston
the forces of Hood soon after traced a devastating march
northward to Dalton. The mischiefs of the great march to
Savannah have frequently been described. Its beginning was
announced by the blaze of burning buildings, and when the
last of the Federal soldiers had set their faces toward the
sea the city of Atlanta was little more than a mass of smoking
ruins. Though the region traversed was probably the
richest in the State, extensive misery accompanied the progress
of the army. The meat and the vegetables needed for
his command were taken by the Union General. Horses,
mules and wagons were freely appropriated; slaves also were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>assisted to escape from their masters. Mills and cotton-gins
were frequently devoted to the flames. In Milledgeville
factories, storehouses and public buildings were destroyed.
The principal edifices of Macon perished about the same time.
Indeed, Augusta was the only considerable place in the State
that escaped serious harm. The people in northwestern
Georgia were in the utmost destitution, large families being
frequently for whole days without food; venerable persons of
both sexes, sinking under the weight of years and infirmities,
often walked fifteen and even twenty miles to procure food
enough to prevent starvation. The injury to all the usual
means of transportation greatly increased the difficulty of
bringing relief. When the conflict had ended, however,
Federal officers did what they could to alleviate the almost
universal distress, and their magnanimity was not without
influence on the future conduct of many an ex-Confederate
veteran.</p>

<p class='c000'>South Carolina, the fatal State that woke the sword of
war, did not suffer greatly in the earlier stages of the conflict,
though even then her foreign commerce was extinguished
and her agriculture interrupted along the coast. Before its
close, however, she was destined to experience most of its
horrors. A restless generation of agitators had assiduously
inculcated the notion that the South was ruthlessly oppressed
by Yankee avarice. This teaching bore fruit, and the people
of South Carolina, coming to regard themselves as little
better than tributary slaves, were easily persuaded to resort
to the wager of battle. With the progress of the contest
this proud State was growing weaker within, hostile pressure
was constantly increasing from without. Time at length and
the fortunes of war had brought round their revenge, and
when the veterans of Sherman turned northward from Savannah
the Palmetto State was powerless to prevent, or seriously
to retard, their advance. Transportation was greatly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>embarrassed by the destruction of the bridges as well as the
tracks of almost every important railway within the State.
Immense quantities of cotton and numbers of cotton warehouses,
uncounted dwellings and depots, machine shops and
foundries, as well as several sailing vessels and steamboats
were consumed by flames. Besides these blackened memorial’s
of disaster and defeat, the stately cities of Charleston and
Columbia were almost simultaneously laid in ruins by great
conflagrations. The inability of the civil authorities to furnish
food for his army constrained General Sherman to forage
for supplies. In this manner all the cattle, hogs, sheep and
poultry, even the little stores of meal, treasured as the last
barrier against want, were consumed, and the people left entirely
without subsistence. To prevent general starvation the
Confederate commander was compelled to distribute the
rations of his soldiers among the wretched inhabitants. From
various causes many ancient and wealthy families found themselves
suddenly reduced to a condition of beggary, and so
low was the condition of the public treasury that the Legislature
as early as the mid-summer of 1865 had already begun
seriously to discuss the question of repudiation.</p>

<p class='c000'>With some slight alterations this picture of South Carolina’s
ills will serve for that of her northern and more deserving
sister, so far at least as concerns those parts overrun
by the contending hosts. The cessation of hostilities stopped
the carnival of death and silenced the engines of destruction
before half of North Carolina’s territory had been crossed.
From the first years of the war there were numerous instances
of privation among the loyalists of that State. Toward its
close the more favored classes also began to feel the pressure
of want. The negroes required and received assistance from
the Freedmen’s Bureau. The whites, refugees as well as secessionists,
were aided by the commanders of the rival forces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Florida, fortunately for her people, was so remote from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>the principal scenes of war that she felt few of its evils.
Battles, it is true, occurred within the State, but they were as
skirmishes compared to the bloody engagements which took
place elsewhere. The same observations are substantially true
of Texas. A fringe of Mississippi’s territory, too, had been
swept by the furnace-blast of war. The extensive movements
around Corinth, Iuka, Vicksburg, Jackson and Port Hudson
will suggest the extent of destruction that visited the northern
half of that State. There existed considerable privation in
that section, though no general distress as in other members
of the Confederacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the Gulf States, however, were not equally fortunate.
Though long impending, the fate of Alabama came swiftly.
Almost in the same hour she was invaded from the north and
menaced from the south. A large portion of her material
resources was already exhausted when the cavalry raids of
General Wilson spread terror and devastation through the
interior counties. The city of Selma was laid in ashes; smaller
towns and villages were likewise consumed by flames; schools
and colleges, private buildings and public edifices perished in
the universal wreck. Monuments of ruin were everywhere
conspicuous throughout a region the most productive, probably,
in all the South. Silence and desolation reigned where
but lately stood proud and hospitable mansions. Nor was
the destruction of wealth or its elements the only injury
sustained, for industry would soon repair the losses of capital.
Labor itself had been severely crippled. Of the army
of 122,000 soldiers which Alabama furnished to the cause
of secession 35,000, it was estimated, had been left on the
field of battle, and at least an equal number had been disabled
for life. Mobile, enriched by the cotton trade, was silent as
some ancient necropolis. Her splendid commerce was ruined;
her stately ships were gone, and the wave broke unheeded on
the shores of her deserted harbor.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>This hurried summary conveys only a very inadequate
notion of the complex problem which Mr. Johnson was forced
to consider. His arduous duty was to repair the ravages of
military violence, to evoke order from the discord of civil
strife, to heal the wounds which the imperious power of slavery
had inflicted upon industries and institutions; in a word,
to restore the harmony of that Republic founded by the wisdom
of Washington and preserved by the policy of Lincoln.
The sentiments of the Chief Magistrate who was about to
attempt this difficult but indispensable task it is now time to
consider. His deliberate conclusions and his spontaneous utterances
are best examined, it is believed, in something like
chronological order.</p>

<p class='c000'>On June 9, 1864, almost a year before his accession to
the Presidency, he had said in addressing the people of
Nashville:</p>

<p class='c013'>But in calling a convention to restore the State, who shall restore and
reëstablish it?... Shall he who brought this misery upon the State
be permitted to control its destinies? If this be so, then all this precious
blood of our brave soldiers and officers so freely poured out will have
been wantonly spilled....</p>

<p class='c013'>Why all this carnage and devastation? It was that treason might be
put down and traitors punished. Therefore I say that traitors should
take a back seat in the work of restoration. If there be but five thousand
men in Tennessee loyal to the Constitution, loyal to freedom, loyal to
justice, these true and faithful men should control the work of reorganization
and reformation absolutely. I say that the traitor has ceased to
be a citizen, and in joining the rebellion has become a public enemy. He
forfeited his right to vote with loyal men when he renounced his citizenship
and sought to destroy our Government.... If we are so cautious
about foreigners who voluntarily renounce their homes to live with
us what should we say to the traitor, who, although born and reared
among us, has raised a parricidal hand against the Government which
always protected him? My judgment is that he should be subjected to
a severe ordeal before he is restored to citizenship.... Before these
repenting rebels can be trusted, let them bring forth the fruits of repentance....
Treason must be made odious, and traitors must be punished
and impoverished. Their great plantations must be seized, and
divided into small farms, and sold to honest, industrious men. The day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>for protecting the lands and negroes of these authors of the rebellion is
past. It is high time it was.<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c010'><sup>[457]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Though he had never been accustomed to conceal his
opinions on questions of public interest, and though there was
no reason for supposing that his views on reorganization had
changed in the months intervening between the Nashville
speech and his inauguration, there was considerable curiosity,
if not indeed impatience, to learn his sentiments on the paramount
issue before the nation. Even the unparalleled excitement
and profound regret occasioned by the assassination of
Mr. Lincoln could not make men forget the grave questions
which the changed conditions of the Union presented for the
consideration of statesmen. Therefore the brief remarks addressed
by the new Executive to those who were present at his
inauguration were eagerly scrutinized for some indication of
the principles which he was likely to adopt in the conduct
of his Administration. The absence, however, of even a hint
on that interesting subject gave universal disappointment, and
anxious patriots were not reassured by his failure to announce
any expression of a purpose to continue the policy of his predecessor.
By his intimate friends this omission was construed
as an intention to pursue in dealing with the South a less
generous course than, it was believed, Mr. Lincoln had
marked out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the more extreme “Radicals” this surmise occasioned
little regret, for they did not object to the accession of
an Executive made, as they believed, of sterner stuff than the
late incumbent. From his fierce denunciation of secessionists
both while military governor of Tennessee and subsequently,
it was generally understood that more stringent methods
would be adopted by Mr. Johnson than had hitherto been employed.
Among other things he said in his inaugural: “As
to an indication of any policy which may be pursued by me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>in the administration of the Government, I have to say that
that must be left for development, as the administration progresses.
The message or declaration must be made by the
acts as they transpire. The only assurance that I can now
give of the future, is by reference to the past.”<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c010'><sup>[458]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Delegations of citizens who waited upon him to tender
their cordial support were assured in the most explicit terms
that his past course was an indication of what his future policy
would be. Three days after entering upon the duties of his
office a deputation of distinguished persons called on Mr. Johnson
under circumstances at once unusual and touching. The
remains of the late President still lay in the White House.
Before the sad procession of the dead left the national Capital
for Springfield, Governor Oglesby, with other gentlemen from
Illinois, called to assure the new Executive of their respect
and confidence. His record, they declared, gave assurance to
their State that in his hands they could safely trust the destinies
of the Republic. The President responded in a speech
discussing a far wider range of topics than he had treated in
his inaugural. Appropriate reference to his predecessor, the
tragical close of whose career was scarcely alluded to in his
first address, was made in this more extended discourse. He
spoke with unaffected and profound emotion. “The beloved
of all hearts has been assassinated,” said he, “and when we
trace this crime to its cause, when we remember the source
whence the assassin drew his inspiration, and then look at
the result, we stand yet more astounded at this most barbarous,
most diabolical act.... We can trace its cause
through successive steps back to that source which is the
spring of all our woes. No one can say that if the perpetrator
of this fiendish deed be arrested, he should not undergo the
extremest penalty of the law known for crime: none will say
that mercy should interpose. But is he alone guilty? Here,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>gentlemen, you perhaps expect me to present some indication
of my future policy. One thing I will say: every era teaches
its lesson. The times we live in are not without instruction.
The American people must be taught—if they do not already
feel—that treason is a crime and must be punished....
When we turn to the criminal code we find arson laid down
as a crime with its appropriate penalty. We find theft and
murder denounced as crimes, and their appropriate penalty
prescribed; and there, too, we find the last and highest of
crimes,—treason.... Let it be engraven on every
mind that treason is a crime, and traitors shall suffer its penalty....
I do not harbor bitter or resentful feelings
towards any.... When the question of exercising
mercy comes before me it will be considered calmly, judicially—remembering
that I am the Executive of the Nation. I
know men love to have their names spoken of in connection
with acts of mercy, and how easy it is to yield to that impulse.
But we must never forget that what may be mercy
to the individual is cruelty to the State.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Commenting on this speech Mr. Blaine, from whom it is
quoted, says that it “was reported by an accomplished stenographer,
and was submitted to Mr. Johnson’s inspection before
publication. It contained a declaration intimating to its
hearers, if not explicitly assuring them, that ‘the policy of Mr.
Lincoln in the past shall be my policy in the future.’ When
in reading the report he came to this passage, Mr. Johnson
queried whether his words had not been in some degree misapprehended;
and while he was engaged with the stenographer
in modifying the form of expression, Mr. Preston King, of
New York, who was constantly by his side as adviser, interposed
the suggestion that all reference to the subject be
stricken out. To this Mr. Johnson promptly assented. He
had undoubtedly gone farther than he intended in speaking
to Mr. Lincoln’s immediate friends, and the correction—inspired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>by one holding the radical views of Mr. King—was
equivalent to a declaration that the policy of Mr. Lincoln had
been more conservative than that which he intended to pursue.”<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c010'><sup>[459]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>To a deputation of New Hampshire citizens he said in part:
“This Government is now passing through a fiery, and, let
us hope, its last ordeal—one that will test its powers of endurance,
and will determine whether it can do what its enemies
have denied—suppress and punish treason.” Though he had
been urged, he asserted, by friends whose good opinion he
valued, he refrained from foreshadowing in a public manifesto
the policy which would guide him. He further observed
on this occasion: “I know it is easy, gentlemen, for any one
who is so disposed, to acquire a reputation for clemency and
mercy. But the public good imperatively requires a just discrimination
in the exercise of these qualities.... To
relieve one from the penalty of crime may be productive of
national disaster. The American people must be taught to
know and understand that treason is a crime....
Treason is a crime, and must be punished as a crime. It
must not be regarded as a mere difference of political opinion.
It must not be excused as an unsuccessful rebellion, to be
overlooked and forgiven. It is a crime before which all
others sink into insignificance; and in saying this it must
not be considered that I am influenced by angry or revengeful
feelings.” He added, that to those who had been deluded
and deceived by designing men, to those who had been only
technically guilty of treason, he would accord amnesty, leniency
and mercy. On the instigators of rebellion, however,
should be visited “the full penalty of their crimes.”<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c010'><sup>[460]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Replying, April 21, to an address of Governor Morton, who
introduced a delegation from Indiana, he said: “Mine has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>been but one straightforward and unswerving course, and I
see no reason why I should depart from it....</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hold it as a solemn obligation in any one of these
States where the rebel armies have been driven back or expelled—I
care not how small the number of Union men, if
enough to man the ship of State—I hold it, I say, a high
duty to protect and secure to them a republican form of
government. This is no new opinion.... In adjusting
and putting the government upon its legs again, I think
the progress of this work must pass into the hands of its
friends. If a State is to be nursed until it again gets strength,
it must be nursed by its friends, and not smothered by its
enemies.”<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c010'><sup>[461]</sup></a> To this delegation he declared himself not less
opposed to consolidation than to dissolution and disintegration.
In a brief reply on the same day to a deputation from
Ohio he added nothing of value to these observations, and on
the 24th of April he addressed in a similar strain a body of
exiles from the South.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The colored American asks but two things,” said the
spokesman of a negro delegation about the same time,
“that he have, first, complete emancipation, and secondly,
full equality before American law.” To this the President
replied, among other things, that he feared leading
colored men did not “understand and appreciate the fact that
they have friends on the south side of the line. They have,
and they are as faithful and staunch as any north of the line.
It may be a very easy thing, indeed popular, to be an emancipationist
north of the line, but a very different thing to be
such south of it. South of it, it costs a man effort, property,
and perhaps life.”<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c010'><sup>[462]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Two months later, June 24, in replying to an address of
a South Carolina committee, he said in part: “The friction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>of the rebellion has rubbed out the nature and character of
slavery. The loyal men who were compelled to bow and submit
to the rebellion should, now that the rebellion is ended, stand
equal to loyal men everywhere. Hence the wish of reconstruction,
and the trying to get back the States to the point
at which they formerly moved in perfect harmony.” He reminded
them that as an institution slavery was gone, and said
there was no hope that the people of South Carolina would
be admitted into either the Senate or the House of Representatives
until by their conduct they had afforded evidence of
this truth. In their circumstances the true policy was to restore
the State government, not through military rule, but by
the action of the people.<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c010'><sup>[463]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Desiring to relieve all loyal citizens and well-disposed persons
from unnecessary trade restrictions, and to encourage
a return to peaceful pursuits, the President removed, April
29, 1865, the interdict on all domestic and coastwise intercourse
in that portion of the late Confederate States east of
the Mississippi and within the lines of national military occupation.
From this order, however, certain named articles
contraband of war were excepted. Military and naval regulations
in conflict with his proclamation were revoked. On
May 22 following he announced that ports in the same district
would be reopened to foreign commerce after July 1,
1865, though certain places in Texas were still denied this
privilege.</p>

<p class='c000'>The insurrection hitherto existing in Tennessee was declared
at an end on June 13, 1865. The authority of the
United States, this Proclamation asserted, was unquestioned
within the limits of that commonwealth, and duly commissioned
Federal officials were in undisturbed exercise of their
functions. All disabilities attaching to the State and its inhabitants
were therefore removed; but nothing contained in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>the order was to be construed as affecting any of the penalties
and forfeitures for treason which had previously been
incurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ten days later, June 23, the blockade of Galveston and
other ports beyond the Mississippi was rescinded. These were
to be opened to foreign trade on the 1st of July succeeding.
It was ordered, August 29, 1865, that after September 1 all
restrictions upon internal, domestic and coastwise commerce
be removed, so that even articles contraband of war might be
imported into and sold in the late insurgent States, the necessity
for prohibiting intercourse in those articles having in
great measure ceased.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an order dated May 9, 1865, the President declared null
and void all acts and proceedings of the military and civil
organizations of Virginia which had been in rebellion against
the General Government; also that all persons who should
exercise or attempt to exercise any authority, jurisdiction or
right under Jefferson Davis, and his confederates, or under
John Letcher or William Smith,<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c010'><sup>[464]</sup></a> and their confederates, or
any pretended commission or authority issued by them, or
any of them, since April 17, 1861, would be deemed and taken
as in rebellion against the United States, and dealt with accordingly.
By the same order the authority of the United
States was revived within the geographical limits known as
Virginia, and the heads of the several Executive Departments
were instructed to enforce therein all Federal laws the administration
of which belonged to their respective offices.</p>

<p class='c000'>To carry into effect the constitutional guaranty of a republican
form of government and “afford the advantage and
security of domestic laws, as well as to complete the reëstablishment
of the authority of the laws of the United States, and
the full and complete restoration of peace within the limits
aforesaid, Francis H. Pierpont, Governor of the State of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>Virginia,” was assured of such assistance from the Federal
authorities as was believed necessary in any lawful measures
that he might adopt for extending the State government
throughout that Commonwealth.<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c010'><sup>[465]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Secretary of the Treasury was directed to nominate
without delay assessors of taxes and collectors of customs and
internal revenue, and such other officers of his Department as
were authorized by law, to execute the revenue laws of the
United States. Preference in making appointments was to
be given to qualified loyal residents of the districts in which
their respective duties were to be performed; but if suitable
persons could not be found residing there, then citizens of
other States or districts should be named.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the matter of appointments similar instructions were
given to the Postmaster-General, who was empowered to establish
post offices and post routes, and to enforce the postal
laws of the United States in the State of Virginia.</p>

<p class='c000'>The heads of the remaining Executive Departments, State,
War, Navy and Interior, were likewise ordered to enforce the
acts of Congress pertaining to their respective offices. The
judge of the United States District Court for Virginia was
directed to hold courts in that Commonwealth, while it was
made the duty of the Attorney-General to instruct the proper
officers to libel and bring to judgment, confiscation and sale,
property subject to confiscation, and to provide for the administration
of justice within the said State in all matters of
which the Federal courts had cognizance.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was this recognition of his government, and this assurance
of support, that induced Mr. Pierpont less than three
weeks afterward to remove his capital from Alexandria. An
account of this event as well as of the nature of the Governor’s
duties in his enlarged jurisdiction, has been anticipated.</p>

<p class='c000'>In recognizing Mr. Pierpont as Governor of Virginia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>President Johnson merely concluded to retain for reconstruction
what had already been accomplished by the loyal minority
of that Commonwealth. Nor is it easy to perceive why,
by rejecting what had been done, he should have increased
the difficulties of a situation even then sufficiently complicated.
While military governor of Tennessee he had executed, and,
so far as appears, without remonstrance, all the measures
recommended by Mr. Lincoln, so that when he succeeded to
the Presidency he was to some extent committed to the policy
of his predecessor. He preserved his consistency by endeavoring
to maintain that system in which he had formerly
acquiesced, and in sustaining the reconstructed governments
of Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee and Virginia it is somewhat
hazardous to affirm that he acted unwisely. More than
this the adherents of President Lincoln could not reasonably
have expected. Mr. Johnson was not, however, required by
any consideration of moment to apply that mode of restoration
to the seven remaining States; nor is it by any means certain
that he had a legal right to do so. With President Lincoln the
problem was to preserve the Union. To effect that object he
believed it necessary to institute loyal governments, and his
action in so doing appears to have been clearly within his
powers as Commander-in-Chief. Had his course been unwise
or even prejudicial to national interests, the reorganization
of those States was still a legitimate war measure to which
his discretion undoubtedly extended. When Andrew Johnson
became President, however, the nature of the problem had
greatly changed, for even though no proclamation had yet
announced the termination of the Rebellion, hostilities had
entirely ceased before he issued the first of his orders on reconstruction.
It was only by something like a legal fiction,
therefore, that the war powers could longer be exercised. It is
believed that his failure to recognize the different circumstances
was an error of judgment. The danger of a renewal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>of the conflict was not sufficiently real to justify a continuance
of the unlimited authority that might be deemed necessary in
time of war. He was aware that Congress had refused to admit
representatives or to count electoral votes from those
States reorganized during the Rebellion, when the action of
the Executive rested on the firm, if somewhat undefined, foundation
of the war powers. After a majority, even in these
circumstances, had pronounced against that system, on what
ground could the new President base his expectation of success?
Without first assuring himself of the coöperation of
the Legislative branch he should not have undertaken the arduous
task of reviving Union governments in those commonwealths
where even the very image of civil authority had been
effaced. Perhaps he had been convinced that the method of
restoration was analogous to the process of terminating war
with a foreign power in which the initiative is to be taken
by the Executive Department of Government. On this subject
Mr. Blaine acutely remarks, that, “There is nothing of
which a public officer can be so easily persuaded as of the enlarged
jurisdiction that pertains to his station.”<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c010'><sup>[466]</sup></a> It was
while executing his measures of reconstruction that Mr. Lincoln
discovered the real sentiments and, to his surprise, no
doubt, encountered the determined opposition of Congress.
In the case of his successor the same excuse cannot be urged,
for he was aware of the temper of the Republican majority,
and appears to have consulted only his courage in espousing
a cause already condemned by many of the most influential
leaders of the party to which he principally owed his election.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the order recognizing the Alexandria government
marked no distinct Executive policy, speculation could still
amuse or employ itself on the expected announcement by the
new President. The first step in that momentous undertaking
was the appointment, May 29, 1865, of William W. Holden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>as Provisional Governor of North Carolina. The order promulgating
that measure was as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>Whereas the fourth section of the fourth article of the Constitution of
the United States declares that the United States shall guarantee to every
State in the Union a republican form of government, and shall protect
each of them against invasion and domestic violence; and whereas the
President of the United States is, by the Constitution, made commander-in-chief
of the army and navy, as well as chief civil executive officer of
the United States, and is bound by solemn oath faithfully to execute the
office of President of the United States, and to take care that the laws
be faithfully executed; and whereas the rebellion, which has been waged
by a portion of the people of the United States against the properly constituted
authorities of the Government thereof, in the most violent and
revolting form, but whose organized and armed forces have now been
almost entirely overcome, has, in its revolutionary progress, deprived the
people of the State of North Carolina of all civil government; and
whereas it becomes necessary and proper to carry out and enforce the
obligations of the United States to the people of North Carolina, in securing
them in the enjoyment of a republican form of government:</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, therefore, in obedience to the high and solemn duties imposed
upon me by the Constitution of the United States, and for the purpose of
enabling the loyal people of said State to organize a State government,
whereby justice may be established, domestic tranquillity insured, and
loyal citizens protected in all their rights of life, liberty, and property, I,
Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, and Commander-in-Chief
of the army and navy of the United States, do hereby appoint William
W. Holden, Provisional Governor of the State of North Carolina,
whose duty it shall be, at the earliest practicable period, to prescribe such
rules and regulations as may be necessary and proper for convening a
convention, composed of delegates to be chosen by that portion of the
people of said State who are loyal to the United States, and no others,
for the purpose of altering or amending the constitution thereof; and
with authority to exercise, within the limits of said State, all the powers
necessary and proper to enable such loyal people of the State of North
Carolina to restore said State to its constitutional relations to the Federal
Government, and to present such a republican form of State government
as will entitle the State to the guarantee of the United States
therefor, and its people to protection by the United States against invasion,
insurrection, and domestic violence; <em>Provided</em>, that in any election
that may be hereafter held for choosing delegates to any State convention,
as aforesaid, no person shall be qualified as an elector, or shall
be eligible as a member of such convention, unless he shall have previously
taken the oath of amnesty, as set forth in the President’s proclamation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>of May 29, A. D. 1865, and is a voter qualified as prescribed by
the Constitution and laws of the State of North Carolina, in force immediately
before the 20th day of May, 1861, the date of the so-called
ordinance of secession; and the said convention when convened, or the
Legislature that may be thereafter assembled, will prescribe the qualifications
of electors, and the eligibility of persons to hold office under the
Constitution and laws of the State, a power the people of the several
States composing the Federal Union have rightfully exercised from the
origin of the Government to the present time.</p>

<p class='c013'>And I do hereby direct:</p>

<p class='c013'><em>First.</em> That the military commander of the Department, and all officers
and persons in the military and naval service aid and assist the said
Provisional Governor in carrying into effect this proclamation, and they
are enjoined to abstain from, in any way, hindering, impeding or discouraging
the loyal people from the organization of a State Government,
as herein authorized.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then followed instructions, similar to those contained in
the order of May 9, relative to Virginia, directing the heads
of the several Executive Departments to enforce those Federal
laws in North Carolina of which the administration belonged
to their respective offices.</p>

<p class='c000'>Somewhat earlier on the same day was published an
Amnesty Proclamation, renewing in effect the provisions of
that issued by Mr. Lincoln on the 8th of December, 1863. It
increased, however, the number of classes excepted from the
benefits of the original offer by adding the following:</p>

<p class='c013'>All persons who have been or are absentees from the United States
for the purpose of aiding the rebellion.</p>

<p class='c013'>All military and naval officers in the rebel service, who were educated
by the Government in the Military Academy at West Point or the United
States Naval Academy.</p>

<p class='c013'>All persons who held the pretended offices of governors of States in
insurrection against the United States.</p>

<p class='c013'>All persons who left their homes within the jurisdiction and protection
of the United States, and passed beyond the Federal military lines into the
pretended confederate States for the purpose of aiding the rebellion.</p>

<p class='c013'>All persons who have been engaged in the destruction of the commerce
of the United States upon the high seas, and all persons who have made
raids into the United States from Canada, or been engaged in destroying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>the commerce of the United States upon the lakes and rivers that separate
the British Provinces from the United States.</p>

<p class='c013'>All persons who, at the time when they seek to obtain the benefits
hereof by taking the oath herein prescribed, are in military, naval, or
civil confinement, or custody, or under bonds of the civil, military, or
naval authorities, or agents of the United States, as prisoners of war,
or persons detained for offences of any kind, either before or after conviction.</p>

<p class='c013'>All persons who have voluntarily participated in said rebellion, and the
estimated value of whose taxable property is over twenty thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='c013'>All persons who have taken the oath of amnesty as prescribed in the
President’s proclamation of December 8, A. D. 1863, or an oath of
allegiance to the Government of the United States since the date of said
proclamation, and who have not thenceforward kept and maintained the
same inviolate.<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c010'><sup>[467]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The proclamation provided, however, that persons belonging
to the excluded classes could make special application for
pardon, when such liberal clemency would be exercised by the
President as was deemed consistent with the facts in each
case, and with the peace and dignity of the United States.</p>

<p class='c000'>Secretary Seward, who attested the proclamation, approved
its general tenor as well as its details. At first he appears to
have opposed the “Twenty-thousand-dollar exclusion,” but
finally yielded to the arguments of the President, who by
this description had hoped to include a numerous class that
did not come under any of those specified. In this respect
it possessed the comprehensive as well as the convenient
character of a general warrant. All attempts to fix responsibility
for secession have proved futile, and it is difficult
to explain the President’s attitude toward Southern men of
property unless, indeed, he meant to humiliate a class that
he personally disliked, or, perhaps, he intended to act upon the
principle that to be mild it is necessary first to appear cruel.
Precisely why the other classes were excepted from the offer
of indemnity the reader of Rebellion literature need not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>informed. The amnesty proclamation applied to all the insurgent
States.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like the “Louisiana plan,” the order appointing Mr. Holden
was based on that clause of the Federal Constitution
which guarantees “to every State in this Union a republican
form of government.” It was in his character of Commander-in-Chief
of the Army and Navy, as well as Executive, that he
assumed to appoint a provisional governor. The Rebellion,
which in its progress had “deprived the people of the State
of North Carolina of all civil government,” he described as
having been “almost entirely overcome.” This condition
rendered it necessary to fulfill the Federal obligation to secure
to the people of that State a republican form of government.
The order being self-explanatory, it only remains to observe
that none but “loyal people” were to participate in electing
delegates to the convention, which it was made the duty of the
Governor to convoke. The term “loyal people” included all
who would take the oath and receive the pardon provided for
in the proclamation. These were required to be qualified
voters under the laws in force immediately before the act of
secession. By this provision the negroes of the State were
excluded from the electoral people, and the work of reconstruction
left entirely in the hands of the whites. The convention
chosen by these citizens, or the Legislature that might
be thereafter assembled, was authorized to “prescribe the
qualifications of electors, and the eligibility of persons to hold
office under the constitution and laws of the State, a power,”
added the order, which “the people of the several States composing
the Federal Union have rightfully exercised from the
origin of the Government to the present time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Governor Holden in a proclamation of June 12, 1865,
announced his appointment and declared his purpose to order
an election of delegates to a State convention, the object of
calling which was briefly noticed. He also made known his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>intention to commission justices of the peace for the purpose
of administering the oath of allegiance and opening the
polls. He urged the people to resume their accustomed pursuits;
refugees were encouraged by an offer of protection to
return to the State, and freedmen were instructed in the duties
peculiar to their altered circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>By a second proclamation, dated August 8, the choice of
delegates to the proposed convention was fixed for September
21 succeeding. Some delay in appointing a date for holding
the election was occasioned by a desire to afford the people an
opportunity of enrolling their names and obtaining the required
certificates.</p>

<p class='c000'>By such voters as were not included in any of the excepted
classes, together with the few who had been able to procure the
Presidential pardon, full delegations were chosen in all but
three counties. The details of this election accessible to the
writer are exceedingly meagre. Owing much to the timely
publication and the admirable character of the orders of General
Schofield, who had exercised the functions of military
governor until superseded by Mr. Holden, the contest appears
to have been free from unusual violence, though newspaper
correspondents, it is true, reported disturbances at several
polling places and mention rumors of rioting.</p>

<p class='c000'>The convention, which assembled at Raleigh on October 2,
was composed for the most part of members who had either
openly opposed or reluctantly joined the secession movement.
There were few, however, who had not given aid and comfort
to the enemy. In other words, they were Whigs and conservative
Democrats. Every representative readily took the
oath to support the Constitution of the United States. The
convention organized by electing Edwin G. Reade, an ex-member
of the Thirty-fifth Congress, as president. On taking
his seat Mr. Reade made an appropriate and conciliatory address.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>The Provisional Governor also submitted to the members
of the convention a brief message in which he observed that
their duties were too plain to require any suggestions from
him. North Carolina, he said, attempted in May, 1861, to
separate herself from the Union. That attempt involved her
in protracted and disastrous war. She entered the rebellion
a slaveholding and emerged from it a non-slaveholding State.
“In other respects,” he declared, “so far as her existence as a
State and her rights as a State are concerned, she has undergone
no change.”<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c010'><sup>[468]</sup></a> He assumed that the convention would
insert in the organic law a provision forever prohibiting involuntary
servitude in North Carolina. The language abolishing
that institution, the form of the resolution abrogating the
ordinance of secession and the nature of the action to be taken
on the war debt were the most important questions before the
convention.</p>

<p class='c000'>On October 7 the repealing ordinance was passed unanimously
in the following terms:</p>

<p class='c013'>The ordinance of the convention of the State of North Carolina, ratified
on the 21st day of November, 1789, which adopted and ratified the
Constitution of the United States, and also all acts and parts of acts of
the General Assembly ratifying and adopting amendments to the said
Constitution, are now, and at all times since the adoption and ratification
thereof, have been, in full force and effect, notwithstanding the supposed
ordinance of the 20th of May, 1861, declaring the same to be repealed,
rescinded, and abrogated; and the said supposed ordinance is now, and
at all times hath been, null and void.<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c010'><sup>[469]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The resolution abolishing slavery, reported on the following
day, was adopted on the 9th of October, and is as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Be it declared and ordained by the delegates of the people of the State
of North Carolina in convention assembled, and it is hereby declared and
ordained</em>, That slavery and involuntary servitude, otherwise than for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>crimes, whereof the parties shall have been duly convicted, shall be, and
is hereby, forever prohibited within the State.<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c010'><sup>[470]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Not without some reluctance there was also adopted a resolution
prohibiting any future Legislature from assuming or
paying any State debt created directly or indirectly for the
purpose of aiding the Rebellion. There seems to have been
in the convention a strong element opposed to the passage of
such a measure, or at all events who preferred to refer it to a
popular vote. The decision of the convention on this subject
appears to have been influenced by a telegram from the President
to Governor Holden, in which the former says:</p>

<p class='c013'>Every dollar of the debt created to aid the rebellion against the United
States should be repudiated finally and forever. The great mass of the
people should not be taxed to pay a debt to aid in carrying on a rebellion
which they in fact, if left to themselves, were opposed to. Let
those who have given their means for the obligations of the State look
to that power they tried to establish in violation of law, Constitution,
and will of the people. They must meet their fate. It is their misfortune,
and cannot be recognized by the people of any State professing
themselves loyal to the Government of the United States and in the
Union....<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c010'><sup>[471]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The convention adjourned October 19 to reassemble on the
fourth Thursday of May, 1866. Judge Reade, its president,
previously delivered a farewell address, in which he said:
“Our work is finished. The breach in the Government, as
far as the same was by force, has been overcome by force;
and so far as the same has had the sanction of legislation, the
legislation has been declared to be null and void. So that
there remains nothing to be done except the withdrawal of
military power when all our governmental relations will be
restored, without further asking, on the part of the United
States. The element of slavery, which so long distracted and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>divided the sections, has by an unanimous vote been abolished.
Every man in the State is free. The reluctance which for a
while was felt to the sudden and radical change in our domestic
relations—a reluctance which was made oppressive to us
by our kind feelings for the slave, and by our apprehensions
of the evils which were to follow him—has yielded to the determination
to be to him, as we always have been, his best
friends; to advise, protect, educate and elevate him; to seek
his confidence, and to give him ours, each occupying appropriate
positions to the other.... It remains for us to return
to our constituents and engage with them in the great
work of restoring our beloved State to order and prosperity.”<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c010'><sup>[472]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>An election, fixed for November 9, was ordered by Mr.
Holden for the choice of Governor, members of a General Assembly,
county officers and Representatives in Congress. On
the same occasion the people were to vote on the ordinance
abolishing and prohibiting slavery. The action of the convention
on the Confederate debt being final, that subject was
not referred to the popular judgment.</p>

<p class='c000'>On behalf of the convention the president and other delegates
soon after adjournment proceeded to Washington to
acquaint Mr. Johnson with the result of their deliberations.
They related to him what has already been placed before the
reader. As the convention had yielded what was involved in
the war, President Johnson was requested to declare on the
part of the Federal authorities that the governmental relations
of North Carolina had been reconciled. Notwithstanding
what had been done they feared that their State delegation
would be excluded from Congress by the imposition of a
test oath which few men in that commonwealth could take.
The convention, therefore, petitioned Congress, through Mr.
Johnson, to repeal the requirement. The President, after expressing
his satisfaction with what North Carolina had done,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>reminded the delegates that to make restoration practicable
one thing still remained to be accomplished, namely, their acceptance
of the amendment abolishing slavery throughout the
United States.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ordinances submitted to the people were ratified at the
November election, when Jonathan Worth was chosen Governor
over Mr. Holden by a majority of 6,730, in a total of
58,554 votes. The repeal of the secession ordinance was
ratified by a vote of 20,506 to 2,002, and that prohibiting
slavery by 19,039 against 3,970.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a dispatch of November 27, President Johnson, thanking
the Provisional Governor for the efficient manner in which he
had executed his duties, said that the result of the election was
greatly to damage the prospects of the State in the restoration
of its government, that if the action and spirit of the Legislature
were in the same direction it would greatly increase
the harm already done, and might prove fatal. He hoped the
mischief would be repaired.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c010'><sup>[473]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the Legislature during a brief session ratified,
with only six dissenting votes, the Thirteenth Amendment,
and elected John Pool and William A. Graham United States
Senators. Seven Representatives in Congress had been previously
chosen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Holden, who continued to perform the functions of his
office until the inauguration of his successor on the 15th of
December, probably owed his appointment to his reputation
as a Democratic editor. Though his rise to political prominence
was similar to that of the President, he had not the
latter’s inflexibility of principle. A secessionist in 1856, when
the success of Fremont appeared probable, he soon began to
recede from that position, and in 1859 was opposed to disunion;
subsequently he drifted with the popular current and
even went so far in an advanced stage of the Rebellion as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>advocate a “last-dollar-and-last-man” resolution. But even
this, together with the expression of extreme opinions, did not
restore him to public confidence, and before the end of the
war the <cite>Standard</cite>, which he edited, became the organ of the
disaffected. Notwithstanding this wavering and inconsistent
career the fact that he was generally regarded as an enemy of
secession singled him out as the proper person to reorganize
the government of North Carolina.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the President was not indifferent to the demoralized
condition of his native State, that consideration alone does not
appear to have induced him to begin the process of reconstruction
with that commonwealth. There is strong testimony to
prove that Mr. Lincoln had prepared a similar proclamation
for restoring the former relations of North Carolina, and on
July 8, 1867, General Grant testified before the Joint Committee
on Reconstruction that he had twice heard read at
meetings of Mr. Lincoln’s Cabinet a paper embodying the
same provisions as that published by President Johnson.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before taking the second step a brief interval elapsed; perhaps
the President was hesitating; however this may be, he
informed Hon. George S. Boutwell that “the measure was
tentative.” The fears of the Massachusetts statesman and his
concern for harmony in the Republican party, of which he was
an able and honored leader, induced him, in company with
Senator Morrill, of Vermont, to call on the President. During
their conversation Mr. Johnson, when the dangers
of his policy were indicated, assured his visitors “that nothing
further would be done until the experiment had been
tested.”<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c010'><sup>[474]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding this deliberate assurance, the President
at that time appears to have almost determined on the system
that he intended to adopt, for scarcely two weeks had passed
when he appointed, by a proclamation similar to that for North
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>Carolina, William L. Sharkey, Provisional Governor of Mississippi.
Within a month from the date of Mr. Holden’s appointment
others were made for all the remaining States except
Florida, the order for reorganizing which was delayed
till July 13.<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c010'><sup>[475]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The origin and development of the Executive plan having
now been traced with some degree of minuteness, it is not the
design of this essay to pursue circumstantially the institution
of that system in the six remaining States. By proclamations
almost identical with that issued in the case of North Carolina,
provisional governors were appointed in all of those commonwealths
before the middle of July. Though the method of
reorganization in these States presented similar features, several
were distinguished in some respects from the others.
Observations on those differences will employ nearly all that
remains to be said on Reconstruction under President Johnson.</p>

<p class='c000'>The appointment of Mr. Holden alarmed Republican leaders;
the successive proclamations for restoring the other
States directed public attention to the questions involved in
reconstruction. Seeing that Congress was not in session, that
the President had assumed an expectant attitude, and that
every plan of reunion proposed was liable to serious objection,
it is not a matter of wonder that the recent Confederate authorities
attempted of themselves to restore Federal relations.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were among the considerations that induced Governor
Clarke, of Mississippi, to summon the Legislature of that
State to meet on May 18. In his address convoking the disloyal
assembly he urged the people, in order to remove the
necessity for sending Federal troops among them, to restore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>and preserve peace. The Legislature came together accordingly,
and, among other measures, provided for the election,
on June 19, of delegates to a State convention. Before that
date, however, the President had appointed William L. Sharkey,
an eminent jurist, Provisional Governor, thus ignoring
both the measures of Mr. Clarke and the insurgent assembly.
The latter was dispersed by a military order, while the Governor
was carried off to a fortress in Boston harbor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Sharkey, in a dutiful and able address, appointed
August 7 as the day for holding an election of delegates to a
State convention which was to meet at the city of Jackson one
week later. In this proclamation, he said: “The negroes
are now free—free by the fortunes of war—free by proclamation—free
by common consent—free practically, as well
as theoretically, and it is too late to raise questions as to the
means by which they became so.”<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c010'><sup>[476]</sup></a> Though the Governor,
to avoid the delay of separate county organization, had appointed
many local officials who had held their posts during
the Rebellion, he required all of them to take the oath of
allegiance prescribed by the President.</p>

<p class='c000'>The convention, which assembled at the appointed time,
declared the ordinance of secession null and void, prohibited
slavery and made it the duty of the next Legislature to provide
for the protection of the person and the property of freedmen.
The lawmaking body was also to take measures for guarding
both the negroes and the commonwealth against any evils
that might arise from sudden emancipation. The first Monday
in October was appointed for the election of State officers
and members of Congress. A memorial was also adopted
urging the President to remove the colored troops from the
State. The members, acting apparently in their individual
capacity, united in a petition for the pardon of Jefferson Davis
and of Governor Clarke. The amendment of the State constitution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>abolishing slavery was adopted by the decisive vote
of 86 to 11. After South Carolina, Mississippi contained
the greatest proportion of slaves, and was thus very deeply
involved in the system.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the convention was in session the President sent to
Governor Sharkey a telegram in which he made the following
remarkable suggestion:</p>

<p class='c013'>I am gratified to see that you have organized your convention without
difficulty.... If you could extend the elective franchise to all
persons of color who can read the Constitution of the United States in
English and write their names, and to all persons of color who own real
estate valued at not less than two hundred and fifty dollars and pay
taxes thereon, you would completely disarm the adversary and set an
example the other States will follow. This you can do with perfect
safety, and you would thus place Southern States in reference to free
persons of color upon the same basis with the free States. I hope and
trust your convention will do this, and as a consequence the radicals, who
are wild upon negro franchise, will be completely foiled in their attempts
to keep the Southern States from renewing their relations to the Union
by not accepting their Senators and Representatives.<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c010'><sup>[477]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>From the view point of practical politics this recommendation
was undoubtedly a wise one, but it will scarcely be contended
that it was the suggestion of enlightened statesmanship.
The South, distrusting the President’s sincerity, refused
to adopt his suggestion. The communication is reproduced,
not to show that the President was not always impelled
by the highest motives so much as to show that even before
Congress had assembled he had already come to regard as
“the adversary” those whose exertions secured his election.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his proclamation appointing a date for the election of
delegates Governor Sharkey advised the people, when it might
be necessary in consequence of the remoteness of a military
force, to form a county patrol for the apprehension of offenders.
Information having reached him that in many parts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>the State organized bands had been robbing and plundering,
and that the Federal troops were insufficient to suppress
these disorders, he urged citizens, especially the young
men who had “so distinguished themselves for gallantry,”
to organize promptly in each county volunteer companies, one
of cavalry and one of infantry if practicable, to assist in detecting,
punishing and preventing crime.</p>

<p class='c000'>From his headquarters at Vicksburg, General Slocum, the
Federal commander, immediately published an order to prevent
the proposed reorganization of the militia. The contemplated
force, he said, would be numerically superior to his
own, and, as many of the Union troops on duty in Mississippi
were freedmen, collisions would be unavoidable. The crimes
referred to by Mr. Sharkey were, the General asserted, committed
against Northern men, Government couriers and negroes.
Southerners, it was true, had been halted by these
marauders, but were promptly released and informed that
they had been stopped by mistake. Citizens who recognized
the persons were unwilling to disclose the names of these
lawless members of the community. The State, too, he
declared, had not yet been relieved from the attitude of
hostility which she assumed against the General Government.
Those engaged in attempts to organize the militia would be
arrested.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fearing that the President would not support General Slocum,
Carl Schurz, who had been sent South on a mission to
assist in carrying out the Administration policy, expressed in
a communication to the President some doubt as to the wisdom
of the Governor’s action. To this the President, in a reply of
August 30, said he presumed that General Slocum, without
first consulting the Government, would issue no order interfering
with Mr. Sharkey in his effort to restore the functions of
the State government. In the matter of organizing patrols
Mr. Johnson took the same view as the Governor, and in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>connection said, “The people must be trusted with their government,
and, if trusted, my opinion is that they will act in
good faith and restore their former constitutional relations
with all the States composing the Union.”<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c010'><sup>[478]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The lapse of fifteen months had worked a revolution in the
opinions of the President. Circumstances, it is true, had
changed since the delivery of his Nashville speech; the main
question, however, had not greatly altered, for it was still
important to determine the political people of the late insurgent
States. From declaring that “rebels” must take a back
seat in the work of restoration, the President had come to believe
that “the people must be trusted with their government.”
It is not to convict Mr. Johnson of inconsistency that his opinions
are here brought into juxtaposition, but rather to inquire
whether every important consideration for ignoring secessionists
in 1864 had disappeared by 1865.</p>

<p class='c000'>On representation from the Provisional Governor that the
Federal commander interfered to prevent the execution of
his proclamation for reorganizing the militia, the President
on September 2 required General Slocum to revoke his military
order. Under instructions somewhat peremptory in tone,
that officer two days later rescinded his proclamation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The condition of the freedmen, as well as their exact legal
status, became about this time the subject of much discussion
in Mississippi. While many continued in the service of their
old masters, numbers roamed about the country in idleness,
and nearly all of them had very extravagant notions of their
newly acquired rights and privileges. Though the whites
admitted of necessity the complete freedom, they were for the
most part unprepared to grant equal rights to negroes. Between
them and their employers, however, there occurred but
little serious trouble. All labor was contracted for, and owners
of plantations, apprehensive that labor would be difficult
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>to secure at the beginning of the season, were anxious to make
contracts for the year 1866. Toward the close of September
the assistant commissioner of the Freedmen’s Bureau turned
over to the civil authorities all the business of his court.
To get rid of military tribunals, Governor Sharkey promised
that in all cases involving the rights of negroes their testimony
would be accepted.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the election, which was held on October 9, General Benjamin
G. Humphreys, late of the Confederate army, was
chosen Governor; immediately thereafter he was pardoned by
the President. Five Representatives in Congress were also
elected. By the Legislature, which convened and organized
one week later, Governor Sharkey was appointed United
States Senator to fill the unexpired term of Jefferson Davis.
For the long term, Mr. J. L. Alcorn was elected. The legislation
relative to freedmen will be subsequently considered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides his complaint to the President relative to the interference
of General Slocum with the proposed reorganization
of the militia, Governor Sharkey expressed dissatisfaction
with the military authorities who refused to obey writs of
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i> issued by local judges. To this Secretary
Stanton replied that the grant of a provisional government did
not affect the proper jurisdiction of military courts, and that
this jurisdiction was still called for in cases of wrong done to
soldiers, whether white or colored, and in cases of wrong done
to colored citizens, and where the local authorities were unable
or unwilling to do justice, either from defective machinery,
or because some State law declared colored persons incompetent
as witnesses. Mississippi was to a considerable extent
still under military law, and the suspension of the writ of
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i> had not been revoked. To a similar remonstrance
the Secretary of State replied that, the commonwealth
being still under martial law, the military power was supreme.</p>

<p class='c000'>On receiving tidings of General Johnston’s surrender, Governor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>Brown, of Georgia, called a session of the Confederate
Legislature, but General Gilmore, who commanded the department
including that commonwealth, issued a counter-proclamation
annulling the late Executive’s order. General
Wilson, in writing the ex-Governor, used expressions that
were needlessly harsh, and whether the language was his own
or that of the President, to whom the commander ascribed it,
the style was neither dignified nor magnanimous. Whoever
may have been responsible for the phraseology, the Union
General appears to have believed in a rigorous exercise of the
rights of conquest. With the defeat of this attempt of the
recent authorities to restore their commonwealth to its old
status, Georgia remained in military hands till the appointment,
June 17, of James Johnson as Provisional Governor.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the work of reconciling the people of that State the Provisional
Executive was assisted by a sensible address of ex-Governor
Brown, and by the support of many leading secessionists.
Now that the “irrepressible conflict” had been settled,
the people appeared anxious for the reorganization of
their State. The 4th of October was early fixed as the date
for holding an election of delegates. The suffrage of citizens
was solicited and received by candidates of ability and character.
These were pledged to advocate the necessary measures
for restoring their commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The convention assembled at Milledgeville on October 25,
was called to order by the Provisional Governor, and elected
Herschel V. Johnson as its president. Instead of declaring
the nullity of the secession and kindred ordinances the convention
“repealed” them. On the question of repudiating the
war debt the vote stood 133 to 117 in favor of the proposition.
This resolution, however, was not carried until November 7,
and appears even then to have been passed only after considerable
pressure from Washington, whence the President directed
or assisted by telegraph the proceedings in all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>reconstruction conventions. The war debt thus declared void
amounted to $18,135,775. The necessity for this action is
evident; the hardships occasioned thereby can be easily imagined.</p>

<p class='c000'>The State constitution, which was thoroughly revised, recognized
the changes that had occurred in civil and social
affairs. In that instrument the freedom of slaves was expressly
declared, and the Legislature was required to make
regulations respecting the altered relations of this class of
persons. The constitution as thus amended was unanimously
adopted by the convention.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though Georgia was not the most loyal supporter of Jefferson
Davis in the time of his prosperity, now that adversity
had overtaken him, the convention, in a memorial to President
Johnson, invoked the Executive clemency in behalf of their
late chief. The convention assumed for the people their share
in the crime for which Mr. Davis and a few others were undergoing
punishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>As in the case of Mississippi, the President approved the
organization of “a police force” in the several counties, for
the purpose of arresting marauders, suppressing crime and
enforcing authority.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Legislature, which was elected November 15, assembled
at Milledgeville on the 4th of December following. With
its proceedings we are not now concerned more than to observe
that the Thirteenth Amendment was adopted by that
body five days subsequently.<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c010'><sup>[479]</sup></a> The measures of the Georgia
Assembly were not before Congress when it convened.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like the chief magistrates in several other Southern States,
the Confederate Governor of Texas, when convinced after the
surrender of General Kirby Smith that the war had ceased,
took steps toward bringing his commonwealth into its old
practical relations with the Union. He accordingly ordered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>an election of delegates to a convention to be held on June
19, but was anticipated by President Johnson, who two days
earlier had appointed Andrew J. Hamilton Provisional Governor.
Though the latter did not promptly appoint a day for
holding the election, he announced his intention of doing so
at an early date. There was probably in the minds of the less
intelligent Texans a notion that emancipation was to be gradual,
or that it was not yet an accomplished fact. To dispel
any such idea the new Executive circulated an address which
informed the public that if, “in the action of the proposed convention,
the negro is characterized or treated as less than a
freeman,” Senators and Representatives from Texas would
vainly seek admission to the halls of Congress. The choice of
delegates having been fixed for January 8, 1866, an account
of the convention or of the proceedings in the Assembly subsequently
organized in that State does not fall within the scope
of this work. In the interval justice was administered by
officers temporarily commissioned for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>The negro population, which, because of the influx from
other Southern States, had doubled since 1860, presented a
difficult problem in the reorganization of Texas. They knew
little of the uses of freedom and were kept systematically at
work only by the candid admonitions of General Granger and
the Governor. Toward the close of December, however, a
better feeling prevailed among them; but it appears to have
been a serious problem to have kept the freedmen of Texas
steadily at work. Planters throughout the State lost heavily
by their inability to engage or to retain in their service laborers
enough to gather the standing cotton crop. The full consideration
of this subject is inseparable from an analysis of
Texan legislation relative to freedmen. Though well advanced,
the reconstruction of Texas under the Executive plan
was not completed before the meeting of the Thirty-ninth
Congress.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>Nothing in the reorganization of Alabama or of South
Carolina calls for especial mention. The same is true of
Florida. Both the spirit and tendency of Southern legislation,
however, require to be noticed, and with that examination
a brief recapitulation will complete this investigation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before concluding this inquiry two related topics require
briefly to be noticed, namely, the character of the reconstruction
conventions, and the <em>personnel</em> as well as the spirit of the
legislatures organized under their authority. As to the former
it may be observed that there were several modes in which
constitutional conventions could have been assembled; all,
however, were objectionable because of an element of irregularity.
Considering them chronologically, rather than logically,
the first was the method employed by the Union men of
western Virginia. The Wheeling convention of June, 1861,
was composed of delegates chosen at elections called, not by
the constituted authorities, for they were already committed
to a policy of rebellion, but by a spontaneous popular movement
inaugurated by loyal and influential leaders. The work
of this body, even though revolutionary, or at least irregular
in its origin, was acquiesced in by the people affected and subsequently
approved by the General Government. So few, however,
were the loyalists of the insurgent States generally, that
it was not practicable elsewhere in the South to reorganize
governments in a similar manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>A second mode was that adopted by Mr. Lincoln. Under
this method, the President, as Commander-in-Chief, protected
Union minorities in their efforts to reëstablish local governments
in harmony with the Federal Constitution. This plan,
it is evident, could be justified merely as a military measure,
and, therefore, was lawful only during the continuance of the
Rebellion. On the return of peace all such provisional schemes
would disappear unless tolerated by the neglect or confirmed
by the legislation of Congress. The conventions held under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>this theory rested on the authority of the commanding officer,
who was himself acting by Executive direction. In reorganizing
the government of Louisiana, General Banks, it will be
remembered, declared that the fundamental law of that commonwealth
was martial law, which was no more than his arbitrary
will. In purging the electoral people and amending the
constitution of that State he acted in strict conformity with
that assumption. If in the preceding pages the reconstruction
measures of Mr. Lincoln have been characterized as legitimate,
it must not be supposed that it was intended to assert that they
would have been lawful in time of peace, for under the American
system it has never been deemed competent for the national
Executive to call a convention. Though the establishments
instituted under his authority, except in the case of
Tennessee, never received the permanent sanction of Congress,
the conventions which organized these governments stand on
a foundation somewhat different from those assembled by the
appointees of President Johnson, for in the summer of 1865
the plea of military necessity could no longer be urged. If,
therefore, the conventions held in Louisiana, Arkansas and
Tennessee were tainted with irregularity, those assembled in
the remaining States were undoubtedly revolutionary. Technically,
however, the conventions of both classes stand on the
same footing. Governor Perry, of South Carolina, regarded
as revolutionary the body which he convoked to reorganize
his commonwealth, and for that reason, as he alleged, dissolved
the convention before it had taken final action on the
important question of the Southern debt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The course of the Confederate governors of Mississippi,
Georgia and Texas, who summoned the insurgent legislatures
of their respective States for the purpose of calling conventions,
suggests a third mode in which the machinery of government
could have been set in motion. This plan, however,
presented an evident difficulty, inasmuch as these assemblies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>could not have been recognized without admitting in some
sort the validity of the secession and kindred ordinances. Mr.
Lincoln, it is true, intended, before hostilities had ceased, to
permit the members of the Virginia Legislature to meet as influential
individuals for the purpose of recalling their State
troops from the Confederate army. The surrender of Lee occurring
soon after, and the President’s action having been misunderstood,
he withdrew this permission, and did it the more
readily as the necessity which suggested it had passed completely
away. The department commanders prevented any
response to the proclamations of the Executives in the three
States named above, and President Johnson by his prompt appointment
of provisional governors ignored or anticipated
their action. To say nothing of the revolutionary course contemplated
by the ex-Confederate governors, the success of
their plan required the approval or at least the connivance of
Federal authorities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still another manner of proceeding was for Congress, by
calling or authorizing conventions, to inaugurate the movement
for reconstruction; but the power of the national Legislature
extends only to the passage of enabling acts for Territories,
and these commonwealths appear to have been neither
constitutional Territories nor constitutional States. However,
as some irregularity was inseparable from any system of
reorganization, the Legislative branch of Government was the
authority least objectionable for controlling informal changes
in the nature of the Union. If powers not conferred by the
Constitution must be assumed, it is better in the interests of
civil liberty for the representatives of the people to transcend
the organic law.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second mode, it need scarcely be observed, was that embodied
in the Executive plan. The conventions which assembled
under encouragement and direction of President Johnson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>had an opportunity unequaled since the formation of the Constitution
of winning the gratitude of the nation. By adopting
an enlightened and humane policy they could have furnished
an example of patriotism that would serve to influence
the deliberations not only of the first assemblies to meet under
the new order, but of all future legislatures in those States.
It is well known that they did not prove equal to this emergency;
the concessions to Northern opinion were not gracefully
yielded, and lost much of their merit by having been
extorted from the fears of the delegates. In some instances
the conventions, by assuming functions of the ordinary legislative
character, transcended their powers, and many of
them “repealed” the ordinances without condemning the
principle of secession. They amended and even adopted
constitutions that were never submitted to the people.
The civil rights of the negro were abandoned to the
mercy of those who had fought to perpetuate human servitude.
No provision was made for freedmen in the fundamental
law, it having been assumed that the new legislatures
could be trusted to extend justice equally to all classes in the
community. In a word, those were disappointed who had
expected from the conventions a display of civic virtues commensurate
to the occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The remaining topic, that is, the character of the reconstructed
governments as well as the spirit and tendency of
their legislation, may in this place be briefly dismissed. Not,
indeed, that the subject is unimportant, for it was mainly upon
this question that the Thirty-ninth Congress justified its refusal
to admit members from the South, and vindicated its
rigorous treatment of the subjugated States. While an investigation
of public opinion in that section is essential to a
correct understanding of legislative action, the full consideration
of the subject belongs properly to a treatise on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>Congressional reconstruction, a theme to which this essay is
only introductory. For the present purpose, therefore, a
brief outline must suffice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the reconstruction conventions were correctly regarded
as revolutionary, that character would not affect the
legislatures instituted by their authority if the people concerned
acquiesced in their proceedings. Americans of that
day were not altogether indifferent to the sacred right of
revolution, even if the principle was not so highly esteemed
as formerly. An objection far more serious than the irregular
origin of these conventions was the spirit which animated
Southern legislators.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Thirty-ninth Congress convened at its first session
members had before them only the merest fragments of
the mass of testimony subsequently reported by the Joint
Committee on Reconstruction, though even then they possessed
evidence of the temper of the Southern mind sufficient, they
believed, to recommend the most deliberate procedure. It
would not be difficult to collect from contemporary literature
proofs of hostility to the General Government sufficient to justify
the attitude of Congress when it assembled on the 4th of
December, 1865. From various sources the Northern people
had caught glimpses of the actual condition of affairs within
the late Confederacy. These manifestations of unfriendliness
to the Union were enough to excite suspicion, and, in a
matter affecting the future welfare of a great and powerful
nation, suspicion is a just ground for inquiry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The alacrity with which the Southern people rushed to
battle, as well as the vigor with which they prosecuted the
war, was a phenomenon not more remarkable than the unanimity
and promptness with which they apparently acquiesced
in the result. It was long before the people of the North could
believe that the rebellion was anything more than a leaders’
insurrection, and they could not easily be persuaded after its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>close that those who had fought so desperately to destroy, were
sincere in their professions of loyalty to, the Union. It was not
unnatural, therefore, that the late adversaries of the South
would look with suspicion on her instant submission. With
few exceptions Southern statesmen seemed desirous of effecting
an early reunion. While various reasons might be assigned
to explain this dutiful and almost unlimited obedience,
it is certain that the argument chiefly relied upon by the provisional
governors was that it was only by such a course that
they could hope soon to be relieved of the presence among
them of Yankee soldiers. Apprehension that more burdensome
conditions might be imposed by Stevens and other
radical leaders in Congress was, perhaps, not altogether without
influence in producing this general acquiescence in the
policy of the President.<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c010'><sup>[480]</sup></a> As every citizen who engaged in
rebellion had forfeited both his life and his estate, it would
be prudent temporarily to conceal any feeling of resentment,
or any desire of revenge. These considerations were not
without influence on the conduct of both the leaders and the
people. With the quick upgrowth, however, of a feeling of
personal safety, encouraged, no doubt, by a lavish distribution
of pardons, and with an expectation, not unfounded, that
reconciliation would speedily be followed by either a restoration
of, or indemnity for, confiscated property, this policy of
conformity would vanish. Thus under exterior tranquillity
rankled bitter memories of disaster and defeat nourishing a
state of unrest which even the unquestioned influence of their
late commanders could not always keep from expressing itself
in acts of violence. However, as Henry Winter Davis had
foretold, the Southern population generally put on the seemly
garb of peace and observed the form of holding elections.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>Notwithstanding that many of their most enlightened citizens
recommended, and that their most trusted leaders enjoined,
submission to the new order, the transition from a
state of hostility was marked even at the outset by acts of
the highest indiscretion. Nor were these confined to irresponsible
individuals whose utterances might have been justly
regarded as the momentary inspiration of passion. Some of
the acts referred to were the deliberate convictions of legislative
bodies, and, as these measures appear to have escaped
criticism, they may fairly be supposed to reflect the sentiments
of the South. In the circumstances this was especially unfortunate,
postponing as it did the day of peace and reconciliation;
it afforded also a decent pretext to the “Radicals,”
if they desired one, for excluding the Southern delegations
from Congress. It justified inquiry, and investigation was
fatal to Southern claims of universal submission.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the exclusion of representatives undoubtedly intensified,
it did not occasion the change in Southern feeling,
for the Mississippi measures, presently to be noticed, were
passed before the meeting of Congress. Acts of frequent
occurrence tended to confirm the worst fears of that
body, and long before the Joint Committee had completed
their labors they were supplied with new species of violence
if any description of outrage was lacking to crown
their indictment. With due allowance for the fact that
during many years preceding the war outrages were much
more numerous in the slave than in the free States, it soon
became apparent that it was unsafe to leave to the justice
of Southern courts either the few Unionists who had
remained faithful in that section or the recently enfranchised
slaves. The estimation in which the former were held appears
in the fact that in competition for office they were uniformly
defeated by ex-Confederate candidates, sometimes by
unpardoned, and even unrepentant ones. The feeling toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>freedmen was one of extreme bitterness. Overlooking
scattered acts of violence and outrage of which negroes were
generally, though not always, the victims, Southern hostility
toward them found unmistakable expression in the November
legislation of Mississippi. On the 22d of that month was
enacted a law regulating the relation of <em>master</em> and <em>apprentice</em>
in the case of “freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes.”
Among other things this statute provided:</p>

<p class='c013'>That it shall be the duty of all ... civil officers ... in this
State to report to the probate courts of their respective counties, semiannually,
... all freedmen, free negroes, and mulattoes, under the age
of eighteen, within their respective counties, beats or districts, who are
orphans, or whose parent or parents have not the means, or who refuse
to provide for and support said minors, and thereupon it shall be
the duty of said probate court to order the clerk of said court to apprentice
said minors to some competent and suitable person, on such
terms as the court may direct, having a particular care to the interest of
said minors: Provided, That the former owner of said minors shall have
the preference, when in the opinion of the court, he or she shall be a
suitable person for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 2.... That the said court shall be fully satisfied that the
person or persons to whom said minor shall be apprenticed shall be a
suitable person to have the charge and care of said minor, and fully to
protect the interest of said minor. The said court shall require the said
master or mistress to execute bond and security, payable to the State of
Mississippi, conditioned that he or she shall furnish said minor with sufficient
food and clothing, to treat said minor humanely, furnish medical
attention in case of sickness, teach or cause to be taught him or her to
read and write, if under fifteen years old, and will conform to any law
that may be hereafter passed for the regulation of the duties and relation
of master and apprentice: Provided, that said apprentice shall be bound
by indenture, in case of males until they are twenty-one years old, and
in case of females until they are eighteen years old.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 3.... That in the management and control of said apprentices,
said master or mistress shall have power to inflict such moderate
corporeal chastisement as a father or guardian is allowed to inflict on his
or her child or ward at common law: Provided, That in no case shall
cruel or inhuman punishment be inflicted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 4.... That if any apprentice shall leave the employment of
his or her master or mistress, without his or her consent, said master or
mistress may pursue and recapture said apprentice, and bring him or her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>before any justice of the peace of the county, whose duty it shall be to
remand said apprentice to the service of his or her master or mistress;
and in the event of a refusal on the part of said apprentice so to return,
then said justice shall commit said apprentice to the jail of said county,
on failure to give bond, until the next term of the county court; and it
shall be the duty of said court, at the first term thereafter, to investigate
said case, and if the court shall be of opinion that said apprentice left
the employment of his or her master or mistress without good cause, to
order him or her to be punished, as provided for the punishment of
hired freedmen, as may be from time to time provided for by law, for
desertion, until he or she shall agree to return to his or her master or
mistress: Provided, that the court may grant continuances, as in other
cases; and provided further, that if the court shall believe that said apprentice
had good cause to quit his said master or mistress, the court
shall discharge said apprentice from said indenture, and also enter a
judgment against the master or mistress, for not more than one hundred
dollars, for the use and benefit of said apprentice, to be collected on
execution, as in other cases.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 5.... That if any person entice away any apprentice from
his or her master or mistress, or shall knowingly employ an apprentice,
or furnish him or her food or clothing, without the written consent of his
or her master or mistress, or shall sell or give said apprentice ardent
spirits, without such consent, said person so offending shall be deemed
guilty of a high misdemeanor, and shall, on conviction thereof before
the county court, be punished as provided for the punishment of persons
enticing from their employer hired freedmen, free negroes or mulattoes.<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c010'><sup>[481]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the matter of apprenticing minors it will be observed
that the former owner, when a person satisfactory to the
court, was to have the preference; in the event of his death
his widow or other member of his family was, if deemed
suitable, to have the preference in re-apprenticing the minor.
When there was no record testimony of the date of birth,
judges of county courts were empowered to fix the age of
the minor. The act was to go into force immediately after
its passage.<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c010'><sup>[482]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The act of November 25, conferring civil rights on
emancipated slaves, provided:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>That all freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes may sue and be sued,
implead and be impleaded in all the courts of law and equity of this
State, and may acquire personal property and chooses in action, by descent
or purchase, and may dispose of the same, in the same manner, and
to the same extent that white persons may; Provided, that the provisions
of this section [1] shall not be so construed as to allow any freedman,
free negro or mulatto, to rent or lease any lands or tenements, except
in incorporated towns or cities in which places the corporate authorities
shall control the same.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Sec. 5.... That every freedman, free negro and mulatto, shall,
on the second Monday of January, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six,
and annually thereafter, have a lawful home or employment, and
shall have written evidence thereof, as follows, to wit: if living in any incorporated
city, town or village, a license from the mayor thereof, and if
living outside of any incorporated city, town or village, from the member
of the board of police of his beat, authorizing him or her to do
irregular and job work, or a written contract, as provided in section six
of this act, which licenses may be revoked for cause, at any time, by the
authority granting the same.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 6.... That all contracts for labor made with freedmen, free
negroes and mulattoes, for a longer period than one month shall be in
writing and in duplicate, attested and read to said freedman, free negro
or mulatto, by a beat, city or county officer, or two disinterested white
persons of the county in which the labor is to be performed, of which
each party shall have one; and said contracts shall be taken and held as
entire contracts, and if the laborer shall quit the service of the employer,
before the expiration of his term of service, without good cause he shall
forfeit his wages for that year, up to the time of quitting.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 7.... That every civil officer shall, and every person may
arrest and carry back to his or her legal employer any freedman, free
negro or mulatto, who shall have quit the service of his or her employer
before the expiration of his or her term of service without good
cause, and said officer and person shall be entitled to receive for arresting
and carrying back every deserting employee aforesaid, the sum of five
dollars, and ten cents per mile from the place of arrest to the place of delivery,
and the same shall be paid by the employer, and held as a set-off
for so much against the wages of said deserting employee: Provided,
that said arrested party after being so returned may appeal to a justice
of the peace or member of the board of the police of the county, who on
notice to the alleged employer, shall try summarily whether said appellant
is legally employed by the alleged employer and has good cause
to quit said employer; either party shall have the right of appeal to the
county court, pending which the alleged deserter shall be remanded to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>alleged employer, or otherwise disposed of as shall be right and just, and
the decision of the county court shall be final.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 8.... That upon affidavit made by the employer of any freedman,
free negro or mulatto, or other credible person, before any justice
of the peace or member of the board of police, that any freedman, free
negro or mulatto, legally employed by said employer, has illegally deserted
said employment, such justice of the peace or member of the
board of police, shall issue his warrant or warrants, returnable before
himself, or other such officer, directed to any sheriff, constable or special
deputy, commanding him to arrest said deserter and return him or her to
said employer, and the like proceedings shall be had as provided in the preceding
section; and it shall be lawful for any officer to whom such warrant
shall be directed to execute said warrant in any county of this State,
and that said warrant may be transmitted without indorsement to any like
officer of another county, to be executed and returned as aforesaid, and
the said employer shall pay the cost of said warrants and arrest and return,
which shall be set off for so much against the wages of said deserter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 9.... That if any person shall persuade or attempt to persuade,
entice or cause any freedman, free negro or mulatto, to desert
from the legal employment of any person, before the expiration of his or
her term of service, or shall knowingly employ any such deserting freedman,
free negro or mulatto, or shall knowingly give or sell to any such
deserting freedman, free negro or mulatto, any food, raiment or other
thing, he or she shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction
shall be fined not less than twenty-five dollars and not more than two
hundred dollars and the costs, and if said fine and costs shall not be immediately
paid, the court shall sentence said convict to not exceeding two
months’ imprisonment in the county jail, and he or she shall moreover
be liable to the party injured in damages: Provided, if any person shall,
or shall attempt to persuade, entice, or cause any freedman, free negro
or mulatto, to desert from any legal employment of any person with the
view to employ said freedman, free negro or mulatto, without the limits
of this State, such person, on conviction, shall be fined not less than fifty
dollars and not more than five hundred dollars and costs, and if said
fine and costs shall not be immediately paid, the court shall sentence said
convict to not exceeding six months’ imprisonment in the county jail.</p>

<p class='c000'>This arbitrary and cruel act, wholly inconsistent with a
state of personal freedom, by forbidding the lease to freedmen,
free negroes and mulattoes of either lands or tenements
outside of cities, not only made of the emancipated slaves a
landless and homeless class, but deprived them of all hope of
rising out of that condition. On the second Monday of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>January, 1866, less than two months after the passage of this
act, and annually thereafter, they were required to have a
lawful home or employment, and to possess written evidence
thereof. This requirement extended to the doing of even
irregular and job work, and a written contract for all labor
for a longer period than one month. If the laborer, without
good cause, left the service of his employer before the expiration
of his term, he forfeited all wages for that year up to
the time of quitting. As the freedmen were wholly without
representation in the State judiciary, the master class could
in every instance determine the sufficiency of the cause. The
intermarriage of the races was made a felony, and the white
or the black person convicted of that crime was to be confined
in the State penitentiary for life.<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c010'><sup>[483]</sup></a> Southern whites had
no objection to the personal attendance, even in first-class
railway coaches, of colored servants, but as other than a servant,
the freedman was considered exceedingly obnoxious,
and this sentiment was enacted immediately before either of
the statutes mentioned, into a law which excluded negroes
from riding in cars of the first class.<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c010'><sup>[484]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There was some apprehension lest this and similar legislation
would lead to bloody outbreaks. The colored race generally
was growing distrustful and discontented. The fear
of violence was probably not unconnected with the passage
of a law approved November 29, which provided:</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 1.... That no freedman, free negro or mulatto, not in the
military service of the United States Government, and not licensed so
to do by the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or carry
fire-arms of any kind, or any ammunition, dirk, or bowie-knife, and on
conviction thereof, in the county court, shall be punished by fine, not exceeding
ten dollars, and pay the costs of such proceedings, and all such
arms or ammunition shall be forfeited to the informer, and it shall be
the duty of every civil and military officer to arrest any freedman, free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>negro or mulatto, found with any such arms or ammunition, and cause
him or her to be committed for trial in default of bail.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 2.... That any freedman, free negro or mulatto, committing
riots, routs, affrays, trespasses, malicious mischief and cruel treatment to
animals, seditious speeches, insulting gestures, language or acts, or assaults
on any person, disturbance of peace, exercising the function of a
minister of the Gospel without a license from some regularly organized
church, vending spirituous or intoxicating liquors, or committing any
other misdemeanor, the punishment of which is not specifically provided
for by law, shall, upon conviction thereof, in the county court, be fined
not less than ten dollars and not more than one hundred dollars, and
may be imprisoned, at the discretion of the court, not exceeding thirty
days.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 3.... That if any white person shall sell, lend or give to any
freedman, free negro or mulatto, any fire-arms, dirk or bowie-knife, or
ammunition, or any spirituous or intoxicating liquors, such person or
persons so offending, upon conviction thereof, in the county court of his
or her county, shall be fined, not exceeding fifty dollars, and may be imprisoned
at the discretion of the court, not exceeding thirty days....</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 4.... That all the penal and criminal laws now in force in
this State, defining offences, and prescribing the mode of punishment for
crimes and misdemeanors committed by slaves, free negroes or mulattoes,
be and the same are hereby re-enacted, and declared to be in full force
and effect, against freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes, except so far as
the mode and manner of trial and punishment have been changed or
altered by law.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 5.... That if any freedman, free negro or mulatto, convicted
of any of the misdemeanors provided against in this act, shall fail or
refuse, for the space of five days after conviction, to pay the fine and
costs imposed, such person shall be hired out by the sheriff or other
officer, at public outcry, to any white person who will pay said fine and
all costs, and take such convict for the shortest time.<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c010'><sup>[485]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Though the General Government was solemnly pledged to
guarantee the entire freedom of the negro, he was completely
disarmed by these statutes, which were to be administered by
men who had been but recently serving the Confederate cause.
The purpose of the last measure is rendered clear by Section 4,
which reënacted against freedmen all the penal and criminal
laws that had applied to slaves. It revived, in short, the black
code of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante bellum</span></i> times.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>Persons convicted of vagrancy, under an amendatory act,
approved November 24, 1865, were subject to a fine not exceeding
one hundred dollars and costs, besides a maximum
imprisonment of ten days. The first section, which defined
who were vagrants, was general in its application. The provisions
especially affecting freedmen were the following:</p>

<p class='c013'>Sec. 2.... That all freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes in this
State, over the age of eighteen years, found on the second Monday in
January, 1866, or thereafter, with no lawful employment or business, or
found unlawfully assembling themselves together either in the day or
night time, and all white persons so assembling with freedmen, free
negroes or mulattoes, or usually associating with freedmen, free negroes
or mulattoes on terms of equality, or living in adultery or fornication
with a freedwoman, free negro or mulatto, shall be deemed vagrants,
and on conviction thereof shall be fined in the sum of not exceeding, in
the case of a freedman, free negro or mulatto, fifty dollars, and a white
man two hundred dollars, and imprisoned at the discretion of the court,
the free negro not exceeding ten days, and the white man not exceeding
six months.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>Sec. 5.... That all fines and forfeitures collected under the provisions
of this act shall be paid into the county treasury for general
county purposes, and in case any freedman, free negro or mulatto, shall
fail for five days after the imposition of any fine or forfeiture upon him
or her for violation of any of the provisions of this act, to pay the same,
that it shall be, and is hereby made the duty of the sheriff of the proper
county to hire out said freedman, free negro or mulatto, to any persons
who will, for the shortest period of service, pay said fine or forfeiture and
all costs: Provided, a preference shall be given to the employer, if there
be one, in which case the employer shall be entitled to deduct and retain
the amount so paid from the wages of such freedman, free negro or
mulatto, then due or to become due; and in case such freedman, free
negro or mulatto cannot be hired out, he or she may be dealt with as a
pauper.<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c010'><sup>[486]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'>No extended knowledge of human affairs is necessary to
perceive that, by a rigorous enforcement of these laws, the
great mass of freedmen could be easily restored to a state of
practical servitude during the season when their labor was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>desirable, and that for the remainder of the year their condition
would be little better than that of the pauper. That the
two races were regarded as equal before the law will scarcely
be contended. An act approved December 1 made it a misdemeanor
in certain cases for either a white or a black man
to hunt hogs or other stock upon any lands other than his
own; the white man was liable, on conviction, to a fine of
from $100 to $500, or imprisonment from one to three
months in the county jail, or both, at the discretion of the
court. For the same offence no imprisonment was provided
in the case of freedmen, and the fine was fixed between $10
and $20. The latter, however, could be hired at public outcry
to the lowest bidder who would pay the fine and cost.
The employer, it was provided, was to have the preference
in hiring.<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c010'><sup>[487]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Legislature first to meet under the reformed government
not only expressed for the people of Mississippi no
profound regret for resisting the Federal authority, but left
no doubt in what estimation it held those who fought for
Southern independence by releasing ex-Confederate soldiers
from indictments for misdemeanors committed before the
war.<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c010'><sup>[488]</sup></a> In perfect harmony with the spirit of this act of oblivion
was one which changed the name of Jones County to that of
Davis, and the name of Ellisville in the same county to Leesburg.<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c010'><sup>[489]</sup></a>
This, it should be observed, was only three days
before the meeting of Congress.</p>

<p class='c000'>This legislation, by no means the most severe enacted
under the new governments, marks in Southern sentiment a
reaction no less unexpected than the complete and almost instantaneous
submission following the surrender of Johnston.
The sudden change in opinion has been ingeniously and even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>absurdly accounted for. In the latter class of explanations
may be included the notion that the people of the South were
exasperated by the interference of Congress, that body, as
already mentioned, not having convened till after the passage
of the obnoxious laws. On the other hand, it was not generally
known, even in Mississippi, that the President in the
work of reorganization had resolved to ignore the coördinate
political branch of Government; he had, indeed, fairly signified
to Governor Sharkey the position that he intended to
assume, but his communication to that official, which was
never designed for publication, was not immediately circulated
through the State; the knowledge, therefore, that the
Executive had concluded to oppose the policy of Congress
could not have been a factor in disturbing the brief repose of
the seceding States, and we must seek elsewhere for the cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>In many of the insurgent commonwealths rebellion had involved
almost every citizen in the guilt of treason, almost
every estate in the liability to confiscation. The President and
his advisers hoped by a generous distribution of pardons to
win the esteem and confidence of this numerous and influential
class, and to leave to “Radical” members of Congress
the ungrateful office of punishment. This policy contributed
to awaken the undaunted spirit of the South, and was, no
doubt, an element in unsettling the conditions that prevailed
after the surrender. Northern magnanimity, which was content
to regard the defeat of secession as sufficient discipline
for the rebellious States, and the attitude of the Democratic
party were also important influences in misleading the South.
More responsible for the reaction, however, than any of these
was the unsatisfactory administration of the Freedmen’s
Bureau. The testimony of General Grant can be cited to
prove that, while accomplishing much that was desirable, this
institution was retarding somewhat the progress of reconstruction.
In a hurried tour of the late Confederate States
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>he had observed that it was not conducted with good judgment
or economy, and remarked in his report to the President
that “the belief widely spread among the freedmen of the
Southern States, that the lands of their former owners will,
at least in part, be divided among them, has come from the
agents of this bureau. This belief is seriously interfering
with the willingness of the freedmen to make contracts for
the coming year.... Many, perhaps the majority, of
the agents of the Freedmen’s Bureau advise the freedmen
that by their own industry they must expect to live. To this
end they endeavor to secure employment for them, and to
see that both contracting parties comply with their engagements.
In some instances, I am sorry to say, the freedman’s
mind does not seem to be disabused of the idea that a freedman
has the right to live without care or provision for the
future. The effect of the belief in division of lands is idleness
and accumulation in camps, towns, and cities.”<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c010'><sup>[490]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Though its management was open to criticism, the necessity
for the existence of the bureau, to afford at least temporary
protection to the newly enfranchised, was perceived and
acknowledged by the General. It probably accorded well
with the political aspirations of bureau agents to create in
the minds of freedmen a belief that the Government would
give to each of them “forty acres of land and a mule”; for
this expectation would be a pledge of allegiance to the Federal
representative, without the approval of whom no negro could
seriously hope to secure so enviable a start in his career of
freedom.</p>

<p class='c000'>That confusion would follow the violent overthrow of a
long-established industrial system was to be expected, and it
was not unnatural for the South to ascribe to the influence
of bureau agents much of the mischief inseparable from immediate
emancipation. While the complaints of the late insurgents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>were commonly considered with deference, it was
scarcely to be expected that they would not sometimes be
despised, and it would be easy to impute to their discontent
every outrage reported to the officers of the bureau or the
commanders of the posts. Though Federal representatives
as a rule labored faithfully to restore and preserve order, it
would be singular if some of them, assuming the arrogant
manner of conquerors, did not occasionally depart from that
system of conciliation which the generous nature of Mr. Lincoln
had adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were among the causes of the Southern reaction.
It is no justification of these severe and even cruel enactments
to show, as Mr. Herbert has done, that similar laws disgraced
the statute books of many Northern States. In the
settlement then in progress the Southern people conceded
nothing of importance that was not won in the war, and if
they were as sincere in their desire for reunion as some writers
contend, they should not have feared the paradox of improving
by their example the ancient legislation of the free States,
or have been alarmed at the innovation of reducing to practice
the principles of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not to be denied that there was considerable ground
for complaint because of the influence of many employees of
the bureau in demoralizing the Southern system of labor, but
the further punishment of a race that had been trodden down
by oppressive generations does not commend itself as either
a humane or an enlightened remedy; besides, the South was
greatly indebted to the fidelity of the negro, who during the
war possessed, without abusing, the opportunity as well as the
capacity for mischief. On the other hand, there was some
obligation to Northern men for their magnanimity, and under
wiser counsels their wishes, and even their prejudices, would
have been respected. In the victorious section public opinion,
then in the formative stage, was watching anxiously the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>progress and the proceedings of the new governments. Except
a few extremists, the voters of the loyal States did not
dream at that time, as was persistently asserted at the South,
of forcing negro suffrage on the rebellious States. They
did, however, desire to see embodied in the new State constitutions
such provisions as would establish before the law
the equality of all classes.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the policy of President Johnson did not altogether
escape criticism at the South, so general and so prompt
was the acquiescence in his plan, that when Congress convened
nearly all the States recently in rebellion had remodeled
their governments and elected members of Congress who
were at the national capital waiting to be admitted to seats.
Without separately considering the new establishments, they
may be described concisely and with sufficient accuracy as
governments differing but little from those extinguished by
the fall of the Confederacy. The members of the former, it
is true, had taken an oath of allegiance, and the influence of
that act upon their conduct will presently be noticed. Though
it certainly was not the original intention, and appears never
to have become the fixed purpose of Mr. Johnson to entrust
to enemies of the Government the work of restoring the insurgent
States, the result of his endeavors was that reconstruction
was left almost exclusively in the hands of those
who had attempted to destroy the Union. It was precisely
such a contingency that Mr. Lincoln had in mind when he
declared in his message of December 8, 1863, that, “An
attempt to guarantee and protect a revived State government,
constructed in whole or in preponderating part from the very
element against whose hostility and violence it is to be protected,
is simply absurd.”<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c010'><sup>[491]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This deliberate statement, as well as the subsequent administrative
acts of Mr. Lincoln, sufficiently disposes of the notion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>that he favored a rather loose system of reconstruction.
Without attempting to distinguish between theories really
identical, there was still a considerable difference in the reorganization
effected under the two Executives. The conditions
which confronted the President and Congress in December,
1865, could have arisen only from disregarding the
principle laid down by Mr. Lincoln. From his solemn and
reiterated declarations there can be little doubt that he would
have rejected without hesitation any system of which the
first fruits were little more than a nullification of his decree
of emancipation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding his tireless threats of severity, we can
easily perceive in the reorganization directed by Mr. Johnson,
a noticeable falling back from the Executive plan of December,
1863, as announced and enforced by his predecessor. Nor did
this retrogression proceed from the greater humanity, but
rather from the greater weakness of the new President. Even
in the matter of fealty there was a difference; for while the
conflict was still doubtful, the taking of an oath of allegiance to
the General Government was a serious step for the Southern
Unionist, because the record thereafter singled him out, if not
for destruction, at least for annoyance, or for punishment by
the friends of secession, and, perhaps, the oath then effected
some such object as it was designed to accomplish. When
war had ceased, however, there was no longer a choice of
sides, and thenceforth universal swearing as an instrument
of government became practically worthless. It was not regarded,
at all events, as an efficient security for the future.
Mr. Johnson probably continued to exact oaths of allegiance
because they were formerly of value in distinguishing the
friends from the enemies of the Government. Though professing
the same general opinion on the subject of amnesty,
the principles on which the two Presidents granted pardons
were sufficiently distinct.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>We have seen that President Johnson, who had once declared
that “rebels” should take a back seat in the work of
reconstruction, so far changed his opinion that he subsequently
said the people must be trusted in the restoration of
their governments; he likewise modified his early impressions
as to the permanence of the establishments instituted under
his predecessor, for it was his original opinion that those
governments were merely provisional in their nature, and
would require the confirmation or the approval of Congress.
Ultimately, however, he came to regard himself as the judge
of their sufficiency. The evidence of this is conclusive. In a
telegram of July 14, 1865, to Governor Sharkey, Secretary
Seward said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The government of the State [Mississippi] will be provisional
only until the civil authorities shall be restored, with
the approval of Congress. Meanwhile military authority
cannot be withdrawn.”<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c010'><sup>[492]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>If it be contended that Mr. Seward made this important
declaration upon his personal responsibility the argument
fails, because in a dispatch to Governor Marvin, of Florida,
dated September 12, 1865, nearly two months later, the Secretary
of State repeated the substance of the message in language
even more explicit. On that occasion he said: “It
must, however, be distinctly understood that the restoration
to which your proclamation refers will be subject to the decision
of Congress.”<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c010'><sup>[493]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The determination of President Johnson to retain the members
of Mr. Lincoln’s Cabinet would indicate his original intention
of applying to the subjugated States the system
adopted by his predecessor. The influence which led to the
modification of the method of enforcing without abandoning
the principles underlying that plan it is not easy to discover.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>His change of attitude toward the South has been variously
explained. By Mr. Blaine it has been ascribed to the flattery
of Southern leaders, as well as to the personal influence of
Secretary Seward, whose wide culture, and consequent humanity,
would favor a policy of conciliation. Without intending
to underestimate the insinuating address of the New
York statesman it may be observed that his powers of persuasion
appear to have exerted themselves with most success in
the direction of the President’s inclination. The attention of
Southern leaders, a class of men by whom the President had
hitherto been ignored, deserves, however, to be noticed in any
enumeration of even the probable cause of the change. Another
theory has it that Mr. Johnson both feared and hated
several of the leading Republicans, because of their connection
with a movement to procure his resignation from the Vice-Presidency,
a station which, they believed, he had disgraced by
appearing in an intoxicated state to take the oath of office.
His desire to punish those who had constituted themselves
custodians of the national dignity, it is asserted, was a principal
motive in his surrender to the South. A more reasonable
explanation of the change which occurred in the President’s
attitude toward his own section is that offered by Dr.
Chadsey, who regards Mr. Johnson as an inconsistent advocate
of State Sovereignty.<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c010'><sup>[494]</sup></a> In this principle he believed as
firmly as Jefferson Davis himself, though unlike the Confederate
chieftain he refused, by stopping short of secession, to
accept its logical results. Nearly all his administrative acts
are those which might have been expected from a Democrat
of the strict construction school, and Andrew Johnson never
professed allegiance to any other political party.</p>

<p class='c000'>The governments of which the reorganization has been
described in the preceding pages continued in operation until
suspended by the Reconstruction Act of March 2, 1867.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>Except Texas all these establishments, as previously observed,
had sent members to the Thirty-ninth Congress. Their claims
to seats, it is well known, were completely ignored, and a
select body, consisting of nine members from the lower and
six from the upper House, was appointed to investigate the
condition of the late Confederate States, and to report whether
any of them were entitled to representation in either branch
of Congress. With the conclusions of the celebrated Joint
Committee this essay is not concerned further than to observe
that on the recommendation of the majority the Tennessee
delegation was admitted on the 24th of July, 1866. Long
before that event, however, the task of restoring the Union
had been taken altogether out of Executive hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we reflect how much swifter in a political organism is the
progress of ruin than that of repair, and consider that four
years had been abandoned to the destruction and disorders of
civil war, we cannot but be surprised at the attempt of the
President, single-handed, to adapt and execute in less than
three months a series of measures designed to restore tranquillity
and revive prosperity among the impoverished inhabitants
of a wasted country. In this view his failure in the
work of reconstruction can excite little astonishment. One
reason for this precipitate action was a desire to reunite the
sections before the meeting of Congress, and it was so far
a praiseworthy if not a prudent course to adopt. But had
he proceeded ever so leisurely there would still have existed
undoubted obstacles to success. To say that he was lacking
in the tact of his predecessor, that he was naturally of an
obstinate and even of a combative disposition, and that he
possessed defects, both of temper and judgment, would
be merely to repeat a few trite observations.<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c010'><sup>[495]</sup></a> Conditions
were rapidly changing, but with Mr. Johnson, conditions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>passed for almost nothing, though in reality circumstances
make legislative acts beneficial or otherwise. Like the measures
of the Thirty-eighth Congress for restoring the Union,
those of Mr. Johnson may be carefully examined without discovering
any considerable traces of originality. Indeed,
if we except President Lincoln, this entire period seems to
have been somewhat lacking in constructive statesmanship,
though no branch of the public service was without officials of
integrity, judgment and ability.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the course of the preceding pages the inaugurals, the
messages, the letters and other communications of Mr. Lincoln
have been freely quoted to show his opinions on all of
the principal and most of the subordinate phases of reconstruction.
To complete the design of this inquiry, there
remains to be considered but a single topic related to the
main theme, namely, the limitations of the Presidential plan
for restoring the Union. Many of these defects having been
incidentally noticed, a general recapitulation does not appear
to be required, and the subject, it is believed, may be appropriately
concluded by an examination of those features of
the Executive system which the narrative has not hitherto
sufficiently emphasized.</p>

<p class='c000'>This summary disclaims, however, any intention of attempting
the absurdity of testing the statesmanship of Abraham
Lincoln by contrasting a method of reconstruction proposed
in 1863 with that deemed adequate by Congress to meet
the changed conditions of 1867. We may, indeed, fairly and
even profitably compare the sentiments of the two political
departments in the summer of 1864, when, for the first time
during the war, they were arrayed in opposition on a fundamental
policy of civil administration. Because of its variance
with received notions of representative government, the so-called
“ten <em>per cent.</em> principle” will be first considered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The proportion of the political people that Mr. Lincoln
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>offered to recognize as constituting a State encountered, probably,
more opposition than any single feature of his plan.
While its merits and its defects were equally evident, the latter,
as might be expected, were given by its adversaries the
place of prominence in all their criticisms. Exception was
taken as well to the legality as to the expediency of the principle.
The former has been fully discussed, and on that subject
all that need be observed is that President Lincoln believed
it constitutional to preserve the Union, and every measure
conducive to that end he regarded as lawful.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the question of expediency, however, several considerations
suggest themselves. Apart from its repugnance to the
American idea of majority rule, its palpable weakness was
that governments founded on the consent of a minimum proportion
of the electors would require the support of Federal
power. Here occurs the question, did the forces thus engaged
so greatly impair the efficiency of the main armies as
sensibly to retard the work of destroying the enemy? It
cannot be denied that there were occasions when a few additional
regiments could have been employed to advantage;
but neither the reverses nor the disasters of the Union armies
were caused by lack of numbers so much as by the need early
in the war of commanders of military genius. On the other
hand, the troops who sustained the new governments, besides
weakening the Confederacy, were affording protection to organizations
that otherwise could not have been recruited.
There is record of not less than sixty-five regiments furnished
by the States restored during the Presidency of Mr. Lincoln.<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c010'><sup>[496]</sup></a>
But even more important than this gratifying result was
the influence which the reinstatement of four seceding commonwealths
exerted on the attitude of those European powers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>which had proved early in the conflict their hostility to the
United States. The “Johnson governments,” so-called, were
never required to furnish any such unquestioned evidence of
reviving loyalty, and that fact should not be overlooked in
any comparison of the results accomplished by the two
Executives.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding the general existence of a strong opposition
to minority rule, the revolutionary proceedings in western
Virginia were sanctioned by every department of Government.
Members from the loyal eastern counties were at
first admitted to seats in both branches of Congress; their
successors, however, were in turn refused this indulgence
until there was presented the novel spectacle of a single Senator
representing the diminished glory of the Old Dominion.
Louisiana, too, which for a few days was heard in the lower
House, was subsequently excluded altogether by the changing
views of Congress. The revived bill of Wade and Davis
provided in one of its many forms for recognizing that State
as well as Arkansas, and even when the extremists obtained
control of Congress the loyal government organized in Tennessee
was approved by avowed opponents of the Executive
plan. Mr. Lincoln, indeed, clearly perceived the inherent
weakness of his system, and no one could have been more
anxious than he to secure a wider constituency. These facts
seem to indicate that between him and Congress there was
not then so wide a gulf as, for partisan purposes, is sometimes
represented. It is true that there was a difference of principle
between the two departments; that there was a powerful
party in Congress who believed that reconstruction was essentially
a work of peace and, therefore, pertained exclusively to
the national Legislature. The holders of this view were,
doubtless, confirmed in their opinion by a conviction that the
Executive was encroaching on a coördinate branch of government.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>The Presidential system as well as the contemporary theory
of Congress restricted the suffrage of whites, by whom it was
almost universally engrossed at the foundation of the Republic.
On the ground of justice and to encourage the cultivation
of civic virtues among the negroes, Mr. Lincoln would admit
those qualified to exercise this important privilege. His successor
acknowledged in a private communication that for
party purposes he favored some extension of the elective franchise
to freedmen. Though Congress advanced rapidly toward
negro suffrage, the first essay of that body in the work
of reconstruction included no provision for conferring on the
colored race a right to participate in government. By
Wade and Davis it was not then deemed necessary
even as a defensive power. Only a few bold innovators,
considered almost fanatic on the question, were in favor of
bestowing the right to vote on the multitudes maintained by
the Freedmen’s Bureau; it was not then deemed within the
commission of the general Government, the teachings of political
science were still respected by the majority in Congress,
and the fruits of victory, it was hoped, could be secured without
a resort to radical measures.</p>

<p class='c000'>The form of an oath to support the proclamations and laws
respecting slavery appeared in the Presidential plan as a condition
indispensable to reinstatement. On this subject the
difference between the Executive and Congress was merely
one of degree; for the Wade-Davis bill, doubtless in imitation
of the Presidential system, imposed terms precedent, and the
new constitutions were to repudiate the rebel debt, abolish
slavery and prohibit the higher insurgent officials, civil as
well as military, from holding the office of governor, from
serving in the State legislatures and even from voting.</p>

<p class='c000'>By its adversaries the plan of Mr. Lincoln was condemned
for its failure to exact any security for the future beyond the
oath of allegiance, the telegraphic supervision by the President
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>and the power of Congress over the admission of members.
This defect the legislative theory endeavored to supply,
but even the guardianship proposed by Wade and Davis could
give no assurance that the rebellious communities would not,
after reinstatement, eliminate by constitutional amendment
the conditions imposed on their readmission.<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c010'><sup>[497]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>However crude we may now consider Mr. Lincoln’s system
it should not be forgotten that with him the paramount
consideration was the overthrow of the Confederacy. With
that purpose all his measures harmonized, and it is scarcely
critical to examine them from any other point of view. How
far necessity, which had originally suggested, would subsequently
have modified his plan it is now impossible to state.
Without detracting a particle from his well-won fame it may
be admitted that his method, which could not have foreseen
the rapid succession of changes following his death, was but
indifferently adapted to solve the problem with which Congress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>was compelled to deal in 1867; but the measure of permanent
success which attended the deliberate legislation of that body
by no means justifies the conclusion that some other system
would have proved a total failure. With all its immaturity
the plan of the President was not without its advantages. It
aimed to restore with as little innovation as possible the Union
of the Fathers; with some exceptions the natural leaders of
Southern society were to participate in the work of reorganization,
and the author of this simple plan approached his
difficult task in a generous and enlightened spirit.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the life and character of Abraham Lincoln an admiring
generation has exhausted the language of panegyric; the
terms of censure have been reserved almost exclusively for his
method of restoring the Union; but neither the critic’s ken,
nor the ambitious phrase of eulogy, nor all the thoughts that
since his death have dropped from poets’ pens affords that clear
insight into his nature which is unconsciously revealed in the
simple and beautiful exhortation that concludes his last inaugural.
The sentiments which immortalize that celebrated
state paper could have proceeded only from the depths of a
noble soul—a soul that would have imposed silence on the
voice of vengeance and would never have consented to the
revenge of section upon section. In this book an endeavor
has been made fully to discuss his plan of reconstruction; the
spirit in which he approached that difficult task is best stated
in his own generous and patriotic words, with which may be
fittingly closed this long though interesting inquiry: “With
malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in
the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to
finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds;
to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his
widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and
cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves, and with
all nations.”<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c010'><sup>[498]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thirty years before President Lincoln published his Emancipation
Proclamation Great Britain abolished slavery throughout her colonies.
Naturally this action was viewed in no friendly spirit by the slave interest
in America, for it brought the free negro to the very door of the
Southern States, and though it was regarded as a menace to the “peculiar
institution,” it was not until a positive loss was sustained that any
controversy arose with England. In October, 1841, the brig <em>Creole</em>, of
Richmond, with a cargo of 135 slaves left Hampton Roads for New
Orleans. The negroes, under Madison Washington, killed one of the
owners, took possession of the vessel and steered her into the port of
Nassau. There those slaves not expressly charged with murder were set
at liberty, and though the administration demanded their surrender
they were not given up. The experience of the <em>Creole</em> was not singular,
several cases of a similar nature being recorded. These facts showed
the danger of navigating the Bahama channel after 1833, and at least
one reason for preferring the overland route down the Tennessee valley
was an expectation of avoiding such accidents.—(See Wilson’s Rise and
Fall of the Slave Power, Vol. I. pp. 443–444; Lalor’s Cyclopedia of Political
Science, etc., Vol. I. pp. 709–710.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r202'>202</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By a joint resolution, approved March 10, 1866, Congress agreed that
both counties formed a part of West Virginia. The parent State, however,
by an act of December 5, 1865, had already repealed both the statutes
of January 31 and February 4, 1863, as well as section two of the act
of May 13, 1862; and on December 11, 1866, a bill in equity was filed in
the Supreme Court of the United States in which it was contended that
it was not the intention of that State to consent to the annexation of
Berkeley and Jefferson counties except upon the performance of certain
conditions; the state of the county on election day was such as not to
permit the opening of all the polls in Berkeley and Jefferson, nor indeed
at any considerable part of the usual election places. The voters did not
have adequate notice. In short, a great majority of them were then and
now, December, 1866, opposed to annexation. Other irregularities are
alleged in the complaint of Virginia. A decision, however, has been rendered
by the Supreme Court of the United States in favor of the new
Commonwealth. [See Virginia vs. West Virginia, 11 Wall., p. 39; also

passed both Houses of Congress, and was approved by the President, Mr.
Davis, of Kentucky, when the members-elect presented themselves before
the Senate, opposed their admission on the ground that there was legally
and constitutionally no such State in existence as West Virginia. On his
motion to administer the customary oath thirty-six Senators voted in the
affirmative, five in the negative. [Globe, 1 Sess. 38th Cong., pp. 1–3.]</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r257'>257</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The question of colonizing free blacks out of the United States engaged
the attention of Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe, who had
some correspondence on the subject at the beginning of the nineteenth
century. Late in the year 1816 there was organized in the city of Washington
the “National Colonization Society,” of which the expressed
purpose was to encourage emancipation by procuring a place outside the
United States, preferably in Africa, to which free negroes could be aided
in emigrating. This, it was believed, would rid the South of its free
colored population which had already become a nuisance. Until 1830 it
was warmly supported everywhere, and branches of the society were
established in nearly every State. In the South its purposes were furthered
by James Madison, by Charles Carroll and by Henry Clay.
Bushrod Washington became president of the association. Rufus King
and President Harrison were among its friends in the North.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though Texas and Mexico were looked upon as favorable places for
locating a colony of free blacks, they were sent to the British possession
of Sierra Leone. In 1821 a permanent location was purchased in Liberia.
This settlement, with Monrovia as its capital, became independent in 1847.
The American Colonization Society attracted little notice after the rise,
about 1829–30, of those known as immediate abolitionists.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r497'>497</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The author believes himself fortunate in being able to place before
his readers a letter from the pen of Hon. J. B. Henderson, the only surviving
Senator who participated in the debates summarized in chapter
X., and, so far as the writer is informed, the only living member who
served in the United States Senate during that eventful period. Coming,
as it does, from one who supported many of Mr. Lincoln’s most cherished
measures, the letter will be welcomed as a valuable historical document.
It contrasts forcibly the Presidential plan with the theory of Senator
Sumner, and though written on August 21, 1901, more than a generation
after the occurrence of the principal events discussed in this book, it is
characterized by the clearness and the energy of expression which marked
even the unpremeditated addresses of the Senator’s Congressional career.
On the subject of reunion he writes as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Time, in my judgment, has stamped its approval on Mr. Lincoln’s
views touching the questions of reconstruction during the Civil War.
He was always calm and judicial. He was philosophical in periods of
the most intense excitement. He never lost his head, but under all circumstances
preserved his temper and his judgment. He was not the
buffoon described by his enemies. On the contrary, he was a wise statesman,
a learned lawyer, and a conscientious patriot; and, better than all,
an honest man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The infirmity in Mr. Sumner’s theories of reconstruction came from
the great exuberance of his learning. He ransacked history, ancient
and modern, for precedents growing out of civil wars. But these precedents
all antedated the American Constitution. They grew out of
monarchical systems of government, and had no relation to the republican
forms created by our Constitution. Under our system there can
be no suicide of a State. Individual citizens by rebellion and disloyalty
may forfeit their political rights, but the State as an entity commits no
treason and forfeits no rights to existence. Under our Constitution the
State cannot die. It is the duty of the Federal Government to see that
it does not die—that it shall never cease to exist. If the State be invaded
from without, the duty of the General Government is to protect
and defend it. If domestic violence threatens the subversion of the local
government, the nation’s duty is to intervene and uphold the hands of
those who maintain the laws. The trustee of an express trust cannot
excuse himself to a minority of the beneficiaries because the majority
repudiate his agency.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a
republican form of government.’ No State government is republican in
form that does not acknowledge the supremacy of the Federal Constitution.
This is the essential test of republicanism. No State can enter
the Union without conforming its Constitution to this supreme organic
law. And whenever by force or violence, a majority of its citizens undertake
to withdraw the State from its obedience to Federal law and
to repudiate the sovereignty of the Federal Government, it at once
becomes the duty of Congress to act.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This duty of Congress is not to destroy the State or to declare it a
suicide, and proceed to administer on its effects. On the contrary, the
duty clearly is to preserve the State, to restore it to its old republican
forms. Its duty is not to territorialize the State and proceed to govern
it as a conquered colony. The duty is not one of demolition, but one of
restoration. It is not to make a Constitution, but to guarantee that the
old Constitution or one equally republican in form, and made by the
loyal citizens of the State, shall be upheld and sustained.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If a majority of the people of a State conspire to subvert its republican
forms, that majority may be, and should be, put down by the Federal
power, while the minority, however few, sustaining republican forms
may be constitutionally installed as the political power of the State.</p>

<p class='c000'>“These, as I understand, were the views of Mr. Lincoln; and they
were not the views of Mr. Sumner, as enunciated in his resolutions of
1862 and advocated by him in his subsequent career in the Senate.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A departure from these views gave us the carpet-bag governments
of the Southern States, and brought upon us divers other evils in our
ideas and theories of government, whose effects are yet visible.”</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
